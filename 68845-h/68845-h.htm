    <div class="preface">
<p>In the following pages, an attempt has been made to present
a connected and reliable account of the movements of the
Thirty Eighth Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers during
its term of service in the army of the United States. It has
not been the purpose of the writer to describe the movements
of armies, or chronicle the results of campaigns, except
to illustrate more fully the doings of the regiment. Even
in the record of battles, he has rather endeavored to confine
himself to the particular part taken by the regiment, than
to any more extended view; and has preferred to give more
prominence to those smaller matters peculiar to its experience.
Nothing has been drawn from imagination, and no attempt
made at word-painting. Neither has it been attempted to
describe the scenery of the country, or the manners of the
people, in the region where the regiment performed its service.
The scope of the work would not allow of this.</p>

<p>Where all, or nearly all, did their duty to the best of their
ability, it would be invidious to single out a few, and bring
them into prominent notice. Consequently, individual names
seldom occur in the text; and where they do, it is only to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
illustrate some movement, or give a clearer idea of the occurrences
alluded to. During thirty-two of the thirty-five months’
service here recorded, the writer was constantly with his regiment,
and noted down the daily events, for the benefit of
friends at home. For the remaining time, including a large
part of the campaign in the Shenandoah, when he was sick in
hospital, he is indebted to the letters, diaries, and conversations
of his messmates, Messrs. Joseph G. Bartlett, Richard A.
Fitzgerald, and Nathaniel Monroe. He would also return his
thanks to Adjutant Wellington, for valuable official papers, and
for assistance, and to Lieut.-Col. Richardson, and Captains
Rundlet, Bennett, Jewell, Howland, and Davis, for the muster-out
rolls of the regiment.</p>

<p>The writer is well aware that the same objects are seen
by different parties in a widely different light; and he
has had a lively illustration of the fact while endeavoring
to learn the movements of the regiment during his absence;
for, while all agreed as to the main points, as soon as
details were entered upon there was a wide difference of opinion,
or of memory. However, he trusts that nothing essential
has been misstated.</p>

<p>The roll of the regiment was compiled from duplicate
copies of the muster-out rolls taken at Savannah, with the
exception of Companies B and H, which were copied from the
rolls in the office of the Adjutant General, whose assistants
courteously permitted them to be used. These rolls contain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
the particulars relating to each man as far as known at the
muster-out of the regiment. Additional items have been obtained
from the non-commissioned officers of the various
companies, and much care taken to have this portion of the
work correct. But owing to the frequent carelessness and
neglect of hospital officials in sending returns to the regiment,
and from other causes, errors may have crept in, which will
not be wondered at, considering the numerous dates and other
minutiæ recorded. With all its faults, the author commends it
to his comrades and to the friends of the regiment, with the
hope that it may occasionally revive old associations, and keep
alive old memories.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Thirty Eighth Regiment of Massachusetts
Volunteers was organized in the summer
of 1862, under the call, issued on the
1st of July, for three hundred thousand
men to serve for three years. For a better
understanding of the circumstances
under which it was raised, a brief glance will be
taken at the state of the country, and the feeling
of the great body of the people in regard to the
war. From the very beginning of the struggle, it
was felt that Virginia was to be the scene of the severest
conflicts; and, consequently, the movements
of the Army of the Potomac had attracted a large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
share of public interest. That army, after a series
of desperate battles, and an almost incredible
amount of hardships, baffled in its attempts to
capture the rebel capital, was recruiting its
strength at Harrison’s Landing. The Union
arms had been successful at various points in the
West; but the batteries of Vicksburg and of Port
Hudson still kept the Mississippi sealed to the passage
of national vessels. Charleston and Savannah
and Mobile boastingly bade defiance to the combined
efforts of army and navy; and the blockade-runners
stole in and out between the ports of the Atlantic
seaboard and foreign parts, supplying the enemy
with the materials of war,—some of them performing
their voyages with almost the regularity
of packets. The Confederacy, notwithstanding its
severe losses, elated at having checked a movement
from which the North had anticipated so much, and
their whole available resources, both of wealth and
population, wielded by a few bold, determined leaders,
looked confidently forward to the final success
of their arms. Foreign powers talked of the Union
as a thing of the past; and even in the North, there
were not wanting those, who, by word and deed,
gave countenance to the foes of the country, and
discouraged every loyal effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>But neither defeat, mismanagement, foreign jealousy,
nor domestic treason, caused the President
to swerve from his determination to restore the
supremacy of the government over the whole country.
Availing himself of the power granted him
by the Constitution and by Congress, he had called
three hundred thousand volunteers into the field
for three years; and, while each State was using
all its energies in raising its quota, a new call was
issued on the 4th of August for three hundred
thousand volunteers for nine months. In Massachusetts,
it seemed at first impossible to raise this
additional force without resorting to a draft. But
the towns vied with each other in filling their
quotas. Public meetings were held; processions,
with banners, and bands of music, paraded the
streets; patriotic songs were sung in the churches,
and stirring appeals made from the pulpit; and
liberal promises were made to care for friends left
behind.</p>

<p>The young men of Massachusetts responded
promptly to the calls upon their patriotism. Leaving
their counting-rooms, workshops, and studies,—with
professions and trades half-learned, and
business prospects broken up,—they went into the
ranks, to undergo the hardships of a soldier’s life,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
and submit themselves to an unaccustomed and
often irksome discipline.</p>

<p>Before the end of the year, Massachusetts had
put twenty-one new regiments of infantry and several
batteries into the field, beside sending a large
number of recruits into all the old organizations.
Among these regiments was the Thirty Eighth.
Without claiming undue merit for the motives or
the deeds of the members of this regiment, or exalting
them at the expense of other troops, it may
be said that few of them enlisted without making
pecuniary sacrifices to a greater or less extent;
and the local bounty of a hundred dollars did
little more than provide them a comfortable outfit,
and purchase the numerous articles then considered
necessary for a soldier’s comfort.</p>

<p>The men composing the Thirty Eighth were
gathered from various towns and counties; and
the majority of them were brought together for
the first time upon their arrival at camp. Seven
of the companies rendezvoused at Camp Stanton,
Lynnfield, and three (Cambridge companies) at
Camp Day, in North Cambridge. Owing to this
division of the regiment, a little confusion existed
at first in regard to the letters by which
the several companies should be designated; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
this matter was amicably settled upon <ins class="corr" id="tn-5" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'the arrival or the'">
the arrival of the</ins> regiment at Baltimore; and, in speaking of
the companies in this sketch, the letters by which
they were finally known will be used entirely.</p>

<p>Co. A was raised in Cambridgeport; Co. B, principally
in East Cambridge; Co. C, in Abington; Co.
D, in various towns in Plymouth County; Co. E, in
Lynn; Co. F, in Cambridgeport; Co. G, in various
parts of Plymouth County; Co. H, in New Bedford
and Falmouth; Co. I, in Milton, Dedham,
Medway, Wrentham, and other places; and Co. K
represented as many as fifteen cities and towns.
In nearly all the companies there were men who
belonged in places not mentioned here, as will be
seen by the roster appended to this sketch. Although
the regiment was thus collected from various
localities, harmony always prevailed. Common
dangers, common sufferings, and common
triumphs, drew the members more closely together
as the numbers decreased; and, when the
final disbandment came, all separated with the
most friendly feelings.</p>

<p>As soon as the various town quotas were filled,
they were sent into camp, and organized into companies
and regiments.</p>

<p>The recruits for the Thirty Eighth were under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
the command of Major D. K. Wardwell, who was
commissioned lieutenant-colonel before leaving the
State, and who enjoyed a high reputation for courage
and practical military knowledge. Col. Ingraham,
holding a commission at the time as lieutenant-colonel
of the Eighteenth Massachusetts, had
been commissioned for the Thirty Ninth; but was
afterwards transferred to the Thirty Eighth. Upon
the promotion of Major Wardwell, Capt. William
L. Rodman, of Co. H, was commissioned to fill the
vacancy. During the stay of the regiment at
Lynnfield, many of the men were absent on furloughs,
and new recruits were being constantly
added, so that little progress was made in drill.</p>

<p>While the seven companies were thus occupied
at Lynnfield, Cos. A, B, and F were being introduced
to military life at Camp Day, in North Cambridge.
The camp at that time was crowded with
recruits for the various regiments and batteries in
the field; and as the accommodations were limited,
the men of the Thirty Eighth were furloughed
nearly every night, reporting at sunrise
in the morning.</p>

<p>Monday, Aug. 18, by invitation of the citizens of
Cambridge, the volunteers visited that city. During
the afternoon, many of the places of business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
were closed, flags were hoisted, and a procession,
composed of delegates from the military and fire
departments, the Cambridge and Irving Literary
Associations, the printing-offices, and police, accompanied
by the city government and a numerous
concourse of citizens, escorted the volunteers
through the principal streets of East Cambridge
and Cambridgeport to the City Hall, where an address
was delivered by the mayor; and from thence
to Williams Hall, where a fine collation was served.</p>

<p>It had been expected that Cos. A, B, and F
would join the regiment at Lynnfield, before leaving
the State, and orders were daily looked for to
that effect. But another course was pursued by
the military authorities. The companies at Lynnfield
were mustered into the United States service
on the 21st, at that place. On the 22d, Capt.
McLaughlin mustered in the Cambridge companies
at Camp Day.</p>

<p>When the army clothing was drawn, many
amusing scenes took place. No. 1 men drew No.
4 clothing, and <em>vice versa</em>. If a small man complained
of an undue proportion of cloth in his
coat, he was pleasantly assured by the issuing
officer that it would shrink. Did a stout boy feel
a pinching in the arms,—it would soon stretch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
According to the style then prevalent, the new
volunteers had cut their hair very short, showing
the phrenological developments distinctly; and
when encased in army blue, their own mothers
barely recognized them. Previously to their departure
from Camp Day, the mothers, sisters, and
friends of the volunteers visited the camp, armed
with needles, thread, and scissors; and the dropped
stitches were taken up, shaky buttons made firm,
pockets inserted, and blankets bound. Each man
was then furnished with a housewife, and all future
repairing turned over to his clumsy fingers, probably
with many misgivings.</p>

<p>The seven companies were furnished with arms
and equipments at Lynnfield; and, during the forenoon
of the 26th of August, the regimental line
was formed, Lieut.-Col. Wardwell in command.
The day was a hot one; and, as the men had not
yet acquired the art of packing knapsacks and
wearing equipments to the best advantage, many
of them were prostrated by the heat. They were
transported in the cars to Boston, and marched
across the city to the Worcester depot, where a
special train was in readiness to take them.
Cos. A, B, and F, not making their appearance
at the appointed time, this portion of the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
embarked at once, and proceeded on their
way.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Camp Day was all alive.
The dinner was on the fire, when the orders to
march were received. Hastily packing knapsacks,
the three companies were soon in line. The citizens
of Cambridge had provided horse-cars to convey
them to Boston; but, in the first flush of
military spirit, they voted to march. The knapsacks,
filled to overflowing with innumerable articles
then considered essential to a soldier’s well-being,
bore heavily on the backs of the new
recruits; and without arms and equipments, and
not fully uniformed, the column had not a very
military aspect as it marched down Main Street.
Dusty and tired, the halt in Cambridgeport was
a welcome one; and justice was done to the collation
provided by the city.</p>

<p>Bidding the last good-bys, and followed by the
good wishes of relatives and friends, the three
companies continued their march. Upon arriving
in Boston, it was found that Lieut.-Col. Wardwell
had already started; but, after a short delay, another
train was made up, and the regiment overtaken
at New London. Quarters were provided
on the cabin floors of the steamer, and the blankets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
spread for the first time. The fatigue and
excitement of the day brought a good night’s
rest, and every one awoke in the morning refreshed;
the decks being soon covered with
men, enjoying the scenery of the river, as the
steamer approached New York; while, from the
cottages along the banks, loyal women waved a
patriotic God-speed to the volunteers.</p>

<p>Passing by New York, the regiment landed at
Jersey City; and there being a scarcity of transportation,
a portion of the regiment did not get
away until afternoon. The companies from Camp
Day had received no rations before leaving; and
the crowd of hucksters, with which the place
swarmed, reaped a rich harvest. Mr. J. C. Wellington,
of Cambridge, came on with the regiment,
and one company was indebted to him for a bountiful
supply of hot coffee,—the first of a series of
kindnesses conferred upon that company and the
regiment, when in garrison and field, which made
his presence always a welcome one.</p>

<p>While waiting at Jersey City, the famous Sixty
Ninth New York arrived at the depot, on their
return from their second term of service. These
real soldiers, who had actually been in battle, were
looked upon with much interest by the untried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
volunteers who were on their way to the scene of
action, and the contrast between the appearance
of the two sets of knapsacks was a suggestive one.
Taking the train vacated by the Sixty Ninth, the
rear of the regiment was soon riding on after the
advance. All through New Jersey, people on the
roadside and in the fields cheered, while flags and
handkerchiefs were waved from the houses. The
men were in excellent spirits, and enlivened the
journey with songs and mirth. Getting passing
glimpses of Newark, Burlington, Princeton, Trenton,
and other historic cities, now invested with
renewed interest, and being liberally supplied with
water whenever the train stopped long enough, the
regiment rode through New Jersey, arriving at
Camden about eight in the evening. Crossing
the ferry, they were taken to the Cooper Shop
Refreshment Saloon, where they partook of a
bountiful collation, and were then conducted to a
long row of wash-basins provided for the purpose.
After the hot and dusty ride, the ablution was
peculiarly refreshing, and was greatly enjoyed.
Again forming in line, the regiment marched
across the city to the Baltimore depot.</p>

<p>Although the passing of troops was now a daily
occurrence, the enthusiasm of the people did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
abate. Ladies waved their handkerchiefs from the
windows, and even grasped the hands of the passing
soldiers from the doorsteps, while men crowded
the sidewalks, and heartily cheered. This enthusiastic
greeting will long be remembered by the survivors
of that column; for it was far more cordial
and earnest than the welcome given them in the
capital of their own State, when after three years’
toil and battle, with thinned ranks, but with an
unstained record, they again marched through the
streets of Boston. Notwithstanding the great number
of troops that had passed through Philadelphia
that summer, the hospitality of the city never
wearied. No regiment was allowed to pass uncared
for; and when returning wounded and sick
from the front, singly or in groups, the same kind
feelings were manifested, and the warm-hearted
ladies with their own hands administered the delicacies
their generosity had provided. Other Northern
cities cared well for the passing volunteers;
but none equalled Philadelphia, whose efforts
were continued as well in seasons of defeat and
gloom as in those of victory and triumph.</p>

<p>Taking the cars after midnight, the regiment arrived
at Baltimore about ten o’clock, the next day,
and marched over nearly the same route taken by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
the Massachusetts Sixth, on the 19th of April, 1861.
No noisy mob appeared to dispute the passage up
Pratt Street; but the sullen, averted looks of the
majority of the people on the sidewalks betokened
no love for the Union. A substantial dinner was
furnished the regiment at the Union Relief Rooms
(for Baltimore had Unionists, whose devotion to
the country was as intense as was their hatred to
Secession); and it was then learned, that, instead
of going to Washington, and thence on to Virginia,
the regiment was to occupy a camp in the vicinity
of Baltimore, about to be vacated by the Thirty
Seventh New York, whose term of service had expired.
A march of a few miles led to the camping-ground,—a
pretty place, in a grove of trees,
formerly known as Druid Hill Park, then called
Camp Belger. There were good facilities for
bathing near the camp; while the shade-trees
furnished cool retreats when off drill. On the
30th, the guns and equipments for Cos. A, B, and
F were received and distributed; and the day was
spent in fitting them.</p>

<p>On the 3d of September, Col. Ingraham arrived
to take command of the regiment. The greater
portion of the time was now occupied in drilling.
Col. Ingraham and Lieut.-Col. Wardwell were both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
thoroughly versed in military tactics; and the company-officers
seconded their efforts in endeavoring
to bring the regiment up to a high standard, in
the manual of arms and in marching. Adjutant
Loring kept a sharp look-out for the whereabouts
of every button, and the polish of every shoe, on
parade; and the surgeons enforced a strict attention
to the rules of health and cleanliness in the
quarters, and about the camp-ground. Thus the
regiment was fairly started on its military career.
What this training resulted in may perhaps be
gathered from the following pages.</p>

<p>On the 5th of September, Co. K was detailed to
guard Stuart’s hospital; and, as it marched out
of the camp, its appearance showed the improvement
that had already taken place in military
bearing. Sept. 7, Mr. Stacy Read, arrived in the
camp with parcels for the Cambridge companies,
showing that the folks at home had not yet forgotten
the absent ones; and as Mr. Read had manifested
great interest in Co. F, that company, by
unanimous vote, adopted the name of “Read
Guard.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the 8th of September, orders came for
the regiment to pack up, and be ready to
march on the following morning. Rations
were cooked, ammunition dealt out, and
the tents struck and packed, Co. F remaining
behind to guard the camp. Owing to
a mistake of the guide, the regiment marched a
number of miles out of its way, causing unnecessary
fatigue.</p>

<p>Co. F marched up the next day. Before leaving
Camp Belger, this company was visited by some
Union ladies from Baltimore, who regaled them
with roast meat, peaches, tomatoes, and biscuits.</p>

<p>The new camp, called Camp Cram, was about
seven miles from Baltimore, near the village of
Powhattan, and in a position to guard the Liberty
turnpike. The rebels were then threatening Maryland
with a large force; and strict orders were issued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
regarding vigilance on guard and picket, and
the importance of keeping a sharp look-out for
spies. One day, a vigilant sentinel seized a suspicious-looking
personage, and brought him to the
officer of the guard. He proved to be a Baltimore
clergyman, and preached to the regiment the following
Sunday.</p>

<p>The tents were pitched on a rising ground,
shaded by large trees. In front of the camp, the
ground sloped down to the Powhattan Creek; and
the battalion drills up and down this declivity
developed the muscles of the men, who were then
little aware of the need they should have of good,
stout limbs to carry them through the pine woods
of Louisiana.</p>

<p>The regiment having no chaplain, religious services
were performed on the Sabbath by Col.
Ingraham, according to the Episcopal usage; and
social religious meetings were conducted by Private
Mudge, of Co. E. The Sabbath services were attended
by citizens from the surrounding country,
and they usually stopped to see the parade. Some
of the companies had not been furnished with uniform
pants in Massachusetts, and as it was a good
while before any could be procured, it may be
imagined that these necessary articles of apparel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
began to show signs of wear, and it required some
manœuvring on the part of line officers to get presentable
men in the front rank. Any other view
of the regiment on one of these parades might
not have added to its reputation. When the new
pants arrived, they were received with a round of
cheers.</p>

<p>A thorough system of drills began at Camp
Cram,—squad, company, battalion, and skirmish;
and, at the close of those warm October days, the
arbitrary “taps” fell on willing ears. The skirmish
drills were conducted by Lieut.-Col. Wardwell,
and were a relief to the monotony of the
battalion and company drill.</p>

<p>The subject of a band had been agitated in the
regiment from the time of their first going into
camp; and measures had been taken to procure
instruments. They were received during the last
week in September, and the band made their first
appearance on parade, Saturday, Sept. 27. This
attraction drew an increased number of visitors
from the surrounding country, especially on the
Sabbath; and the camp was enlivened by the presence
of country dames, in their holiday attire, who,
during the week, had done a thriving business in
selling pies and apple-butter to the soldiers. Co.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
K, in the meantime, having performed the duty
required of them very acceptably, had returned to
the regiment, with an improvement in drill which
caused increased emulation among the other companies,
and raised the standard of military acquirements
still higher in the command.</p>

<p>While the Thirty Eighth were thus acquiring
proficiency in drill, and inuring themselves to life
in the open air, stirring scenes were being enacted
within cannon sound. The distant boom of the
guns at Antietam were heard in camp; and orders
were looked for every day, which would send the
regiment to the front. One gallant Massachusetts
regiment (the Thirty Fifth), that had left the State
but a few days previous to the Thirty Eighth, had
already been in the thick of the fight, and had lost
heavily.</p>

<p>In a few weeks, the tide of war again rolled
northwards, and the troops of Stonewall threatened
Pennsylvania. On the 11th of October, the Thirty
Eighth received orders to be ready to move the
next day. Tired of the monotony of camp-life,
the news was received joyously; and the camp
rang with the shouts of those to whom the unknown
perils of the battle-field had a strange fascination.
Far into the night, busy hands were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
at work packing knapsacks; and many an article
which kind but inexperienced friends at home had
considered indispensable to their soldier-boy’s comfort
was left behind.</p>

<p>Early Sunday morning, Oct. 12, the regiment
broke camp, and began the march toward Baltimore.
No one would have recognized this body
of drilled soldiers, with neatly packed knapsacks,
marching with steady step and closed ranks, as
the procession of awkward recruits who passed
through the same streets less than six weeks previously;
and in after times, when disease and battle
had reduced them to a remnant, the survivors
of the column looked sadly back in memory upon
that October morning, when the long line followed
its commander over the Maryland hills.</p>

<p>Marching through the city of Baltimore, the
regiment took the cars for Chambersburg, but had
not proceeded a mile, when the orders were countermanded,
the train called back, and the troops
disembarked. Quarters were procured in the machine-shops
for the night; and the next morning,
after breakfasting at the Union Relief Rooms, the
regiment marched to Camp Emory, on the outskirts
of the city, on property owned by the relatives
of Charles Carroll, of Revolutionary fame.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
The One Hundred and Twenty Eighth New York
had been encamped on a part of the ground, but
had gone to Chambersburg, leaving a lofty flagstaff
and a pile of boards for tent-floors, both of
which were appropriated at once by the Thirty
Eighth; but upon the return of the former regiment,
the flagstaff was returned, and a loftier one
procured, which was afterwards transferred to the
One Hundred and Fiftieth New York.</p>

<p>The old routine of drill was now resumed. Col.
Emory commanded the division to which the Thirty
Eighth was assigned; and the men here first saw
the stout old soldier who afterwards became such a
favorite leader.</p>

<p>On the 28th of October, an order came from
Gen. Wool for one company to go to Baltimore
on special service. Co. F went through the city
on the double-quick, with loaded muskets and
fixed bayonets; but their services were not required,
and they came back to camp rather disgusted
at having added nothing new to the fame
of the regiment. It was rumored in the camp,
that some one had insulted the hostler of a general,
and a squadron of cavalry and a body of infantry
were ordered out to avenge it.</p>

<p>While at Camp Emory, the regiment received a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
visit from the Rev. Mr. Ware, of Cambridge, a
gentleman who always manifested great interest
in its welfare, and whose kindness will long be remembered
by its members.</p>

<p>In this camp, the companies drilled daily in
“reversed arms,” for the purpose of attending the
funeral of some officer who had died, or was expected
to die. But their services were never called
for; and it became one of the regimental legends
that the officer had refused to die upon hearing
that the Thirty Eighth were drilling for the purpose
of burying him.</p>

<p>Toward the end of October, the weather began
to get cool, and every one looked uneasily forward
to a winter in tents in Maryland; but as a new well
was almost completed, and a new guard-house begun,
the men still had hopes of getting away.
Col. Ingraham was now acting brigade-commander,
and Lieut.-Col. Wardwell in command of the
regiment; and brigade and division drills took
place several times a week.</p>

<p>During the first week in November, marching
orders were received, and preparations were made
to embark on ocean transports; but the regiment
did not break camp until Sunday, the 9th. A few
days previous, there had been a severe snow-storm,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
which would have done honor to Massachusetts;
and every one was eager to get into a warmer
climate. Just before the cold weather, Mr. Wellington,
of Cambridge, had visited the camp, and
furnished each of the members of Co. F with a
pair of gloves, a present from Mr. Stacy Read.
The band of the One Hundred and Fiftieth New
York escorted the regiment through the streets of
Baltimore to the Union Relief Rooms, where a good
meal was furnished them. Quarters for the night
were found in unoccupied houses; and the next
day the regiment was taken down Chesapeake Bay
in small steamers, and transferred to the steamship
Baltic, which had been selected by Gen. Emory as
his flag-ship. The ship stopped a short time off
Annapolis to take on board two companies of the
One Hundred and Thirty First New York, and
then proceeded to Fortress Monroe, arriving at
Hampton Roads on the morning of the 8th.</p>

<p>The victories of Farragut had not yet added
their brilliant record to the achievements of our
navy; and the scene of the little “Monitor’s” victory,
and of the “Cumberland’s” glorious death,
was eagerly studied, while one of the officers, who
had been an eye-witness to the engagement, related
the story to a group of interested listeners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>For nearly a month, the regiment remained on
shipboard at Hampton Roads, occasionally going
on shore to practice target-shooting and to drill.
An amusing incident occurred at this time, the
memory of which will bring a smile to many a
face. There had been no facilities for washing
clothes since leaving Camp Emory, and the regiment
had not yet roughed it long enough to become
accustomed to dirt; so one day, when it
was announced that the knapsacks were to be
taken on shore, and an opportunity given to wash
clothes in fresh water, soap became in demand,
and all anticipated one more cleaning up before
going into the field. A tiresome march through
the streets of Old Point Comfort, by the “contraband”
village rising around the chimneys of
ruined Hampton, brought the regiment to the
vicinity of a creek; and soon the bank was lined
with busy washers. But the soap furnished by
Uncle Samuel had no effect upon the dirt contracted
on his transports. Suddenly some one
discovered that the creek was a salt-water one.
The washing fever subsided, and the regiment
went back wiser, but very little cleaner.</p>

<p>Day after day slipped by, and still there was no
movement. On the 18th of the month, the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
received their first visit from the paymaster,
being paid off on the deck of the ship. The companies
changed quarters more than once on board
the “Baltic,” and had the opportunity to test the
comparative hardness of nearly all the beams in
the ship. It required skill in gymnastics to go
from the bunks to the deck without coming in
contact with some animate or inanimate body.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving Day found the regiment still at
anchor, <em>waiting</em>. The men went on shore in the
morning, and had the liberty of the beach and of
the sutlers’ stores until afternoon. Many had
received “boxes” from home; and turkeys and
puddings graced impromptu tables, spread on the
beach, the fresh sea-breeze giving a flavor superior
to any gravy. Those whose boxes did not arrive
in time picked up a dinner in private houses,
saloons, and at the counters of the sutlers, who
were liberally patronized, and who long remembered
the Thirty Eighth.</p>

<p>At length, the “horses came on board,” and the
signs of departure seemed to multiply. Lieut.-Col.
Wardwell resigned before the regiment left
Fortress Monroe; and his resignation was accepted,
to take effect from Dec. 3. Major Rodman succeeded
to the vacant lieutenant-colonelcy, to date<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
from Dec. 4; and Capt. Richardson, of Co. A, was
promoted major. The two companies of the One
Hundred and Thirty First had been transferred to
another ship, and the Thirty Eighth had the Baltic
to themselves.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THURSDAY morning, Dec. 8, everything was
astir in Hampton Roads. Important little
tug-boats sputtered and whistled; quartermasters’
boats brought off their last supplies
of fresh bread and meat; and tardy officers
joined their regiments. About nine o’clock,
<span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, the Atlantic weighed anchor, and led the
way to sea, followed, at intervals, by the Ericcsson,
the Spaulding, the Arago, the Pocahontas,
and others of the fleet. Slowly steaming between
Fortress Monroe and the Rips Raps, their decks
covered with troops, and their flags blowing out
clear in the fresh breeze, the ships presented a
fine sight. About four o’clock, the Baltic weighed
anchor, and followed the fleet, the gun-boat Augusta
bringing up the rear, as convoy. Of course,
the destination was the great theme, and rumors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
flew thick and fast, but nothing definite was
learned.</p>

<p>The weather was very beautiful; and the men
thronged the deck, reading, writing, and watching
the movements of the strange fishes and birds
which occasionally made their appearance. There
was comparatively little sea-sickness, and the general
health of the regiment was good. The cooking
facilities were poor. The galley, in which coffee
was boiled, and salt-beef cooked for a thousand
men, was of the smallest proportions; and those
who went through that voyage have a vivid remembrance
of “big Charlie” bending over the
meat-boiler. Notwithstanding the inconveniences,
there was little grumbling; and the division commander
expressed himself well pleased at the orderly
conduct of the men. Charleston, Pensacola,
and Mobile were passed, and still the ship kept on
her course. At length, the appearance of a large
fleet, hovering around a low island, told that the
destination was reached. The place of rendezvous
proved to be Ship Island, much to the disgust of
the regiment, who had conceived a strong dislike
against this place. In truth, it looked as if a large
wave might wash the whole concern, with its military
storehouses and fort, into the Gulf of Mexico.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
Here it was learned that New Orleans was the
destination; and, as the Baltic drew too much
water to cross the bar off the mouth of the Mississippi,
the Thirty Eighth had to land on the island,
and await the return of some of the lighter draft
transports. Part of the regiment disembarked on
the evening of the 13th, and the remainder followed
the next day; glad enough to be once more
on terra firma, if this sand-bank could be so denominated.
Although near midwinter, the temperature
was mild; and the beach was soon covered
with bathers, enjoying the luxury of a good plunge
in the water after such a long sea-service. There
was no chance to be dirty while here. Tin dippers
and plates shone with a lustre that would have excited
the admiration of a Knickerbocker housewife;
and the muskets were bright and polished. The
sand was everywhere, and must have assisted the
stomach wonderfully in digesting the antediluvian
hard-tack occasionally issued.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of fatigue work to do
here, unloading stores, and transporting ammunition;
and even the drilling through the sand was
unusually fatiguing. At this time, there was a
number of political prisoners on the island, rendering
service to the government, and strengthening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
their own muscles, by pounding stones. Some of
them had been prominent citizens in New Orleans,
and had been banished to this place, by order of
Gen. Butler, for acts of disloyalty to the Union.
The soldiers of the Thirty Eighth looked upon
these persons as “the right men in the right
place,” and cordially endorsed the policy of “Old
Ben.”</p>

<p>A number of the larger transports had been unable
to cross the bar; and the island was dotted
with canvas villages. Drilling was resumed by
the various regiments, and prosecuted vigorously,
although the marching in the sand was fatiguing.
Christmas was now near at hand. On the evening
of the 23d, after brigade drill, the colonel addressed
the regiment briefly, stating that they
would probably spend Christmas there, and that
he wished them to enjoy the day as well as they
could under the circumstances. The camp was
to be given up to the regiment from ten o’clock,
<span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, till “tattoo;” they were to elect their own
field, staff, and line officers; make their own camp-regulations,
and hold the regimental officers to a
strict observance of them, punishing any violation
of them with confinement in the guard-house.
The men entered into the proposal with spirit.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
Committees were appointed from the different
companies, line officers elected; and the camp
scoured for materials with which to get up a
mock parade. Santa Claus did not make his appearance.
The jolly old saint, in his fur cap,
would have been sadly out of place in that sunny
clime. One poor fellow, in a fit of absent-mindedness,
hung up his stocking in his tent, but indignantly
rejected the idea that the army pastry
found therein was from the old friend of his boyhood.
He thought the other “Nick” had more
dealings with the commissary department. The
day opened with a good breakfast of baked beans.
After breakfast, the regiment was drawn up around
the colonel’s tent, when the Christmas service of
the Episcopal Church was read by Col. Ingraham,
the band and a volunteer choir assisting in making
the service interesting. The camp was then
“turned over” to the regiment, the colonel holding
the power in reserve to check the proceedings
if they became disorderly. The regular guard being
relieved, a new guard and police detail was at
once made out, selected from the ranks of the
commissioned and non-commissioned officers. In
the forenoon, a burlesque dress-parade took place,
which furnished much amusement to all concerned;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
and, considering the limited materials on
the island, was quite successful. The series of
orders read by the adjutant’s clerk were <em>slightly</em>
personal, and good-humoredly embodied the complaints
of the men against certain obnoxious
changes in the drill, and regarding other regimental
matters. During the day, the officers
were nearly all under arrest for some violation of
the “orders of the day.” One Timothy Ingraham
was taken to the guard-house for attempting to
leave camp without a pass. Giving a satisfactory
excuse, he was released. Other officers were not
as fortunate; and some of them worked out the
penalty of their offences with the shovel. The
Christmas dinner consisted of a bountiful supply
of salt-beef and hard-tack, washed down with cold
water. The afternoon was spent in rambling over
the island, each one enjoying himself in his own
way. About five o’clock, a dress-parade took
place, conducted exclusively by enlisted men,
each company doing its best to make the parade
creditable. The officers loaned their uniforms for
the occasion to those selected to command the regiment
and companies; and they acknowledged that
the reputation for drill which the regiment enjoyed
at this time did not suffer during the temporary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
transfer of authority. During the evening, some
<ins class="corr" id="tn-32" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'amusing court-martials'">
amusing courts-martial</ins> took place; but, as it is not
the purpose of the writer of this sketch to “tell
tales out of school,” the mere mention of it will be
sufficient to bring the scene before the minds of
those who participated in the events of the day.
“Tattoo” dissolved the spell. The companies fell
in for roll-call, the guard went on again, and shortly
after nine o’clock, the lights were all out, and
perfect quiet reigned in the camp. Nothing occurred
during the entire day to mar the peacefulness
of the festival. There had been no quarrelling,
no drunkenness, and no infraction of military
rule.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 28th, the long-looked for
transports made their appearance. There was an
immediate inspection of knapsacks; but personal
property had dwindled down to a small compass,
and there were few articles to be left behind. The
cooks were busy all night preparing rations; and
orders were given to be ready to start at ten in the
morning. At noon, the tents were struck; but
there being a large amount of commissary stores
to put on board, the regiment did not embark till
midnight; those not on duty grouped around
the camp-fires, “laying up sleep” for the future.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
As the regiment marched to the wharf, the band
played “Yankee Doodle,” bringing many of Gen.
Butler’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protegés</span> to the doors and windows of their
quarters. Embarking on the transport Northern
Light,—a large California packet-steamer, much
better adapted to convey troops comfortably than
the majority of government vessels,—the men
gladly sought their canvas-bottom bunks; and
about sunrise, on the morning of the 30th, the
steamship weighed anchor, and steered for New
Orleans. Although the residence on the island
had not been an unpleasant one, none were sorry
to see its outlines fade in the distance, or wished
to revisit it. On the morning of the 31st, the ship
crossed the bar, and entered the Mississippi; few
on board then anticipating the long months that
were to pass before their eyes would be gladdened
by the sight of the blue water again. The sail up
the Mississippi on this last day of the year was an
interesting one to Northern eyes. The large plantations
of corn and cane, dotted over with negroes,
looking like so many charred stumps on a partially
cleared field; the orange-trees laden with fruit;
the mansions of the wealthy planters, half hidden
by fresh-looking shrubbery; the rows of neat,
white-washed negro cabins; the tall chimneys of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
the sugar-mills in the rear; with the back-ground
of forest-trees, gray with the Spanish moss,—formed
a picture in striking contrast to the winter-scenery
the northern-bred volunteers had been
accustomed to.</p>

<p>Two sunken gun-boats near Forts Philip and
Jackson reminded the Thirty Eighth that they
were in the same department with “old Farragut,”
and that, in any co-operation between the
land and sea forces, the army would have to look
to its laurels. On the way up the river, another
transport was passed, containing the Forty Seventh
Massachusetts; and the two regiments exchanged
friendly greetings. Being the last day of the
month, the regular inspection and muster took
place on the deck of the steamer; and, to show
the good health of the regiment on entering the
Department of the Gulf, it may be stated that one
company, which left Boston over four months previously
with ninety-five enlisted men, mustered
ninety-one for inspection,—four having been left
behind, sick, at Fortress Monroe.</p>

<p>A little after dark, the long line of lights
was seen glimmering on the river-edge, marking
the outlines of New Orleans. The steamer cast
anchor in the stream near the upper part of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
city; and the deck was soon deserted by all except
the guard, who paced their beats, “watching” the
old year out, and the new year in.</p>

<p>At noon, the ship steamed up the river to Carrollton,
one of the suburban towns of New Orleans,
where the regiment landed. It was the first day
of January; but the orange-trees were in bloom,
the roses perfumed the air, and the vegetables
were growing vigorously. This was the “Sunny
South” indeed. The new camp had at one
time been occupied by rebel troops, and was well
adapted for drilling. On one side of the Thirty
Eighth, the One Hundred and Sixteenth New
York were encamped, and, on the other side, the
One Hundred and Seventy Fifth; beyond which,
were the Forty Seventh Massachusetts. Between
the Thirty Eighth and the One Hundred and Sixteenth,
a friendship sprung up, which lasted during
the entire term of service; and although the
One Hundred and Sixteenth were soon transferred
to another brigade, and afterward to another division,
whenever the two regiments met on a campaign,
friendly greetings were exchanged; and
this, notwithstanding the fact that they were
rivals, each aspiring to take the lead in drill and
efficiency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>While at Carrollton, Col. Ingraham took command
of a brigade, and never rejoined the regiment.
He participated in the first part of the
Tèche campaign; but, being unable to endure field
service in the climate of Louisiana, was appointed
Provost Marshal at Washington, in which position
he gave such satisfaction that he was retained in
service by special order after the regiment was
mustered out, and brevetted as brigadier-general.
A few days after arriving at Carrollton, the regiment
experienced its first Louisiana rain-storm.
The camp-ground was soon intersected by miniature
bayous; and, as the drains were not in good
order, some of the streets were completely flooded;
while the tents, being old, afforded but little shelter
from the storm. The company streets, after one
of these winter-rains, were like so many mortar-beds.
Much has been written about the Virginia
mud, in connection with the Army of the Potomac;
but, if it equalled that of Louisiana, the face of the
country in that part of Virginia must have been
greatly changed by the movements of the armies;
and the mixing of soil will afford matter for study
for future agriculturists. As soon as the regiment
was fairly settled in camp, drills were resumed
with vigor. During the stay on Ship Island, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
manual of arms had been changed: the old system
was now restored, much to the satisfaction of the
men. On the 6th of the month, Gen. Banks, accompanied
by Gens. T. W. Sherman and Emory,
visited the camp. The regiment was engaged in
battalion drill, at the time; and, as the visitors
approached, were drawn up into line to receive
them. Then, the Thirty Eighth, as far as regarded
appearance, were in their prime. Disease
had not yet thinned the ranks; four months’
drill, under competent field and line officers, had
brought them to a high standard in the manual
of arms and in battalion movements; Adjutant
Loring had paid particular attention to the personal
neatness of the men; and the men were not
yet discouraged by those gloomy accounts which
afterward came from the North, showing a want
of faith in the ability of the army to put down
the rebellion, and an unwillingness to strengthen
it by reinforcements of good men. As spring
drew near, the camp was full of rumors in regard
to the coming campaign; and three days’
rations were kept cooked most of the time.</p>

<p>At midnight, on the 11th, sudden orders came
to “fall in” for sixty rounds of cartridges each;
to pack knapsacks, and put two days’ rations in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
haversacks. It was rumored that the rebels operating
up the river had been largely reinforced by
troops from Richmond, under Longstreet, and
that the <ins class="corr" id="tn-38" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Thirth Eight were'">
Thirty Eighth were</ins> to join the main
body of the Army of the Gulf. The knapsacks
were to be packed, and left behind, and the camp
left standing, the troops going into the field in
light marching order. After waiting until the
middle of the forenoon, the orders were countermanded,
the extra cartridges returned, and drill
resumed.</p>

<p>On the 24th of January, the Thirty First Massachusetts,
Col. Gooding, who had been doing duty
at the forts, arrived, and went into camp near the
Thirty Eighth, Col. Gooding taking command of
the brigade. At this time, brick ovens were built
in the camp, and the regiment had their baked
beans regularly Sunday mornings.</p>

<p>During the first week in February, the division
drilled together at Camp Parapet, near Carrollton.
On the 3d, the One Hundred and Sixteenth struck
tents, and marched off in the direction of Baton
Rouge; and, in a few days, their camp was occupied
by the Fifty Third Massachusetts,—a nine-months’
regiment, who were in the third brigade
until their term of service expired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>On the morning of the 10th of February, the
knapsacks were again packed preparatory to a
move; but the tents were left standing, and the
camp put in charge of the light-duty men, of
which there were then a large number.</p>

<p>When the regiment first arrived at Carrollton,
the general health was unusually good; but the
change in the water, the dampness of the low land,
and the frequent guard-duty had made their mark,
and thinned the ranks.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark before the regiment embarked
on the first of the numerous river-boats with which
they afterward became so familiar. A thick fog
came up during the night; and, in the morning,
the boat was found to be snugly moored to the
river-bank, near a large plantation, the mansion-house
being then occupied as a signal-station;
but the fog cleared up during the forenoon, and
the boat proceeded on her voyage. The sail
was a pleasant one, and was greatly enjoyed; and,
as the river had risen since the arrival of the
regiment at New Orleans, it presented a nobler
appearance than at that time. Plantation after
plantation stretched along the banks, on both sides
of the river; but few of them showed any signs of
activity. The residences of many of the planters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
indicated taste and refinement; and, in some instances,
the negro cabins had a very attractive and
picturesque appearance. These plantations may
have belonged to men of the St. Clare school; but
no Evas were seen sporting among the roses, or
Uncle Toms “keeping an eye on things.” During
the afternoon, Jefferson College was passed, and,
still later, a large convent, prettily situated near
the river, with grounds tastefully laid out. About
midnight, the boat arrived at Plaquemine, an old-fashioned,
dilapidated looking town, but which is
said to have been a thriving place before the rebellion,
when the Mississippi was covered with steamers,
and the products of the cotton and cane-fields
were filling the coffers of the plantation princes.
The few citizens who remained had evidently not
lost their hope of the ultimate success of the
South; for Confederate paper was worth half as
much as greenbacks.</p>

<p>Sunday afternoon, Feb. 15, the Louisiana Belle
arrived at Plaquemine, having on board Gen.
Emory and staff; and she was soon followed by
another boat, with the One Hundred and Fifty
Sixth New York, and Col. Ingraham and staff. A
gun-boat started with them, but broke down on the
way, and put back for repairs. A portion of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
Thirty Eighth being on the upper deck of the
transport, and exposed to the weather, quarters
were procured for Cos. C and F in unoccupied
houses on shore. It was after dark when they
landed, and raining hard. The mud was knee-deep
in the streets, and the night pitchy dark.
After floundering along for half an hour or more,
it turned out that the guide had lost his way, and
the two companies had to countermarch, and retrace
their steps part of the way. In after times,
many a laugh was had over the misfortunes of that
night; but, at the time, Mr. Webster and Mr.
Worcester would have been astonished at the capabilities
of the English language in furnishing expletives.
Finally, the house that had been selected
for quarters was found; and all except the unlucky
guards were soon oblivious of the mishaps of military
life. Afterward, several of the remaining
companies were transferred to quarters in the town.</p>

<p>The regiment drilled, as usual, at Plaquemine;
and the men often wondered when that lazy soldier-life
they had heard so much about was going
to begin; for, hitherto, with drill, guard-duty,
fatigue, and rifle-cleaning, they barely had time to
answer their letters from home.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the gun-boat had arrived; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
a number of men acquainted with boat-service had
been detailed from the regiment, and sent up the
Bayou Plaquemine in launches, on a reconnoitring
expedition. While awaiting the return of the
boats, the sugar-houses in the vicinity were visited,
and candy-making became the order of the evenings.
In the succeeding months, the molasses-candy
expedition was often recalled, and its incidents
talked of over the camp and picket fires.</p>

<p>The reconnoitring party returned with the information
that the bayou was completely obstructed
by piles and immense drifts of logs, and that it
would be impossible to force a passage through.
In consequence of this report, the troops again
embarked, and the transport headed down the
river, reaching the landing at Carrollton at six
o’clock on the evening of the 19th. In the
morning, the march was taken up for Camp Kearney,
where everything was found in order, although
the camp bore evidence of having been pretty well
flooded by the rains of the previous week. A mail
had arrived during the absence of the regiment,
and it had been sent up the river, to the disappointment
of every one. Numerous absurd rumors
concerning disaster to the regiment had been
brought down the river, and one had found its way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
into the New Orleans papers, to the effect that
nine companies of the Thirty Eighth had been captured.
Acting upon this information, the sutler
had packed up his wares, and gone to another regiment,
concluding that his chances of money-making
in the Thirty Eighth were at an end.</p>

<p>Immediately upon arriving in camp again, the
tents were struck, and the floors taken up, that
the sun might dry up the dampness. On Sunday,
Feb. 22, divine service was performed in the camp
by Col. Ingraham, the band, and a select choir
from the ranks, assisting; and the day was further
honored by the firing of a national salute from
Camp Parapet.</p>

<p>On the 26th, by the advice of the surgeon, the
regiment were to have “a rest, not more than
three hundred men having come out the day before
for battalion drill;” but in the afternoon, however,
an order came from brigade head-quarters
for the regiment to have skirmish drill. Capt.
Rundlet, being in command at the time, deployed
the left wing as skirmishers, drilling them especially
in the movement of “lying down;” the right
wing, in the meantime, remaining in reserve. This
order did not increase the popularity of the brigade
commander. On the last day of the month, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
regiment was again mustered for pay. On that
day, also, a number of boxes reached camp, which
had been sent to the regiment when at Fortress
Monroe. They had been intended for Thanksgiving,
but did not reach their destination until the
fleet had sailed; and three months’ confinement
had reduced the turkeys and chickens to skeletons,
and the puddings and pies had not increased
in flavor.</p>

<p>During the month, the regiment lost several valuable
members from disease. On the 3d, Orderly
Sergt. Samuel J. Gore, of Co. E, died of typhoid
fever, and was buried under arms; and on the
4th, Sergt. Charles A. Howard, of Co. A, died of
the same disease. Sergt. Howard received a commission
as lieutenant in another regiment a day or
two before he died. On the 3d of March, the Sergeant-major,
Walter W. Nourse, added another to
the list from this fatal disease. Sergt. Nourse
came out as 1st Sergt. of Co. F, and was the pet
of that company, as well as a favorite with the
whole regiment. Resolutions expressive of their
sympathy were forwarded by Co. F to his bereaved
friends; and they also testified their respect for
their comrade, by having his body embalmed, and
sent home, where imposing funeral obsequies took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
place upon its arrival, and touching tributes to his
memory were published in the newspapers.</p>

<p>During the first week in March, a regimental
well was dug; and marching orders were at once
expected, for, hitherto, these events had followed
each other in close order; and the rule was not
now to be broken. On the 4th, the cooks had orders
to cook rations. The next day, drill was dispensed
with, and orders were issued to pack knapsacks,
and be ready to move at a moment’s notice.
Somewhat experienced in marching orders, the
men made themselves quite easy over it, not
expecting to get away for several days. Consequently,
they were taken completely by surprise
to hear the “assembly” just after dark, followed
immediately by the “orderly’s call” and the “officers’
call;” and there was quite a hubbub in the
camp. At first, there was supposed to be trouble
in New Orleans; and the men were elated at the
prospect of having something to do. That morning,
one company had brought out but twenty-eight
men for drill,—thirty-five reporting sick,
and a number being detailed,—but, in a few minutes
after the assembly was heard, sixty men were
in line, equipped for active service; and the same
spirit was shown in all the other companies. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
was soon learned that the duty to be performed
was near home, and was not relished so well.
There had been some trouble in the One Hundred
and Seventy Fifth New York; the men refusing to
go on the campaign until they were paid, they not
having received any money since their enlistment.
Their camp was surrounded by the other regiments
of the brigade with loaded muskets and
fixed bayonets; but, after a short address from
the brigade commander, the men of the One Hundred
and Seventy Fifth returned to duty, and the
Thirty Eighth and the other regiments were released
from their unpleasant task.</p>

<p>The next morning opened with a drizzling rain.
At noon, orders were given to strike the tents on
one side of the company streets, and put the knapsacks
in those of the other side; and this was
barely done, when the rain began to pour in torrents,
and continued to do so for the remainder
of the day. Three days’ rations were put in the
haversacks, and all the regimental baggage packed.
The One Hundred and Seventy Fifth had started
in the morning; and the Fifty Third broke camp
in the midst of the rain, and marched to the
levee; but the Thirty Eighth lingered until evening,
when orders came to strike all the remaining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
tents, and take the baggage to the cars, which
passed near the camp. The mud grew deeper
and deeper, as the men wallowed through it; and,
as the night was very dark, it was a difficult task
to keep in the track. A large detail had been sent
to store the baggage on board of the transports,
and there were so many on the sick-list that it
took the remainder nearly all night to load the
cars. The few hours before morning were spent
around the camp-fires; and, at sunrise, the regiment
marched to the levee, stacked arms on the
sidewalk opposite, and proceeded to put the remainder
of the baggage, quartermaster’s stores,
&amp;c., on board of the St. Mary’s. It was a very
carnival of mud; and soon every one was coated
with it. About noon, the regiment embarked;
and tired, sleepy, muddy, and packed like sardines,
the men coiled themselves up in all shapes,
and slept soundly in the hot sun. The boat arrived
at Baton Rouge the next morning, and found
the river full of gun-boats, mortar-boats, and transports;
and signs that the campaign was about to
open were everywhere apparent. Landing on the
levee, the Thirty Eighth marched through the
streets of the old capital of Louisiana to the
Theatre Building, where they were quartered.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Although the climate and the unwholesome water
had begun to do its work, the regiment was still
comparatively strong, some companies taking near
seventy men into the field; and the long rows of
stacked muskets on the floor of the Theatre had a
martial look, and spoke of work in the future.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">BATON ROUGE was alive with troops, belonging
to every branch of the service.
Staff-officers and orderlies were galloping
through the town; quartermasters and
commissaries were full of business; and
flags were waving continually from the
signal-towers. A few citizens were to be seen in
the streets, grim and sullen; but they were almost
lost amid the blue-coats. The Thirty Eighth had
orders to pack their dress-coats, and all other
articles except blankets, overcoats, and a change
of clothing. Old soldiers may smile at this idea
of “light-marching order;” but the men had not
yet learned how little baggage was necessary for
comfort and health.</p>

<p>Wednesday, March 11, the iron-clad Essex, so
famous in the annals of Mississippi warfare, arrived
at Baton Rouge, and was inspected with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
much interest by the troops. This boat was the
wonder and delight of the contraband population;
and amusing stories were told of the effect produced
upon both black and white Southerners,
when she first made her appearance before the
city. Another examination was made in the
division now, and the sick men, and those
unable to endure the fatigue of field service,
were sent to the hospital, and the command
stripped to its marching and fighting material.</p>

<p>Shelter-tents were issued on the 11th; and
during the first march, everybody carried tent-pins,
with which to pitch them; and this in
a densely wooded country. The Thirty Eighth
were proficient in the manual of arms, and could
go through battalion movements creditably; but
they were not yet soldiers. On the 12th, the
division was reviewed by Gens. Banks and Emory,
accompanied by a large and brilliant staff, Admiral
Farragut being present, and the centre of attraction.
Although the knapsacks had been reduced
somewhat, the addition of the shelter-tents, and
twenty extra rounds of cartridges, made the load
fall heavy enough to be on the back from eight in
the morning till one in the afternoon, when the
review closed. The force on the field consisted of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
thirteen regiments of infantry, three batteries, and
several companies of cavalry; and the review took
place on the old battle-field of Baton Rouge, near the
spot where Gen. Williams was killed, the marks of
the bullets then fired being still visible on the trees
and fence-posts.</p>

<p>While at Baton Rouge, an order was issued by
Gen. Banks, very complimentary to the Thirty
Eighth. After a severe rebuke of the manner in
which the officers of certain regiments had performed
their duties, as shown by the reports of the
Inspector-General, the order went on to say:
“The Commanding General cannot forbear pointing
to the marked contrast indicated in the same
reports concerning the condition of the Thirty
Eighth Massachusetts and the One Hundred and
Sixteenth New York Volunteers, enlisted at about
the same time; but carried, by the zeal and laudable
ambition of their officers, beyond the reach
of this pernicious influence.”</p>

<p>Although very flattering to officers and men, it
was afterward thought that this order did not contribute
much to the comfort of the regiment when
under the control of brigade officers whose own
commands were thus unfavorably contrasted with
it. At six o’clock, on the evening of the 13th,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
orders came to fall in; and the line was formed in
front of the Theatre. Being on the left, the Thirty
Eighth remained in line while the division moved
by; and cheers were exchanged, as the various
regiments which had been connected with the
Thirty Eighth passed, the One Hundred and Sixteenth
being loudly greeted. When the time came
for the regiment to move, Gen. Dudley, whose
quarters were opposite, addressed it in a few words,
concluding with, “Men of the Thirty Eighth,
keep cool, obey orders, and fire low.”</p>

<p>After leaving the city, and passing through the
camps of Dudley’s Brigade, which formed the
reserve, and which was not to move until the next
day, the road led through dense woods, where the
vines and creeping-plants wove the forest into an
almost impenetrable barrier, which shut out every
ray of light. The column made slow progress,
and the innumerable halts were as tiresome as the
marching; but about midnight, the bugles sounded
a halt, and the army went into camp for the night
in a corn-field. When the rear of the column
reached the camp, the field was ablaze with camp-fires,
and the fumes of the coffee were rising in the
air. Up to this time, the company cook had done
all the cooking, but each man had now to prepare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
his own rations, or go without. Upon going into
camp, the troops were informed that the plantation
belonged to a “Union man,” and that they were
only to take the “top rails” for fires. This order
became a standing one in the Nineteenth Corps,
and, during the campaign, they made it a point to
take only the top rails, <em>as they found them</em>. The
men were too weary to pitch the new shelter-tents;
and rolling their blankets round them, all except
the camp and picket guard were soon asleep.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">reveillé</span> was beaten at two o’clock, and an
early breakfast cooked. By this time, the “top rails”
were more accessible than on going into
camp.</p>

<p>At daylight, the march was resumed. The day
proved to be a hot one; and the roadside was soon
strown with blankets, overcoats, knapsacks, and
other articles thrown away by the regiments in
advance. It was apparent that the army was rapidly
coming down to light-marching order. Contrabands
hung on the flank and rear, picking up
the cast-off garments. Some of the men, not yet
having made up their minds to part with their
overcoats, cut off the sleeves and skirts to lighten
their loads. After marching about eleven miles,
the column halted and went into camp in a cane-field,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
and stacked arms, a picket being thrown out.
The sun came down hot, and the shelter-tents were
found to be convenient. Toward night, the sound
of heavy guns was heard in the vicinity of Port
Hudson, and the cannonading continued through
the night, while the shells from the gun-boats could
be plainly seen bursting over the fort. The
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">reveillé</span> was beaten at four o’clock. The firing at
Port Hudson had ceased; but a large mass of
flame, which had been supposed to be some portion
of the enemy’s works, set on fire by the guns from
the fleet, began to move slowly down the river,
accompanied, at intervals, by explosions. All eyes
were fixed on the mysterious light, and many
gloomy forebodings indulged in. Had Farragut
been defeated, and the fleet been destroyed by
some infernal machine? Or was this one of the
marine abortions of the enemy, committing suicide?
Suddenly, at daylight, the mass of fire
seemed to leap high in the air, followed by a dense
column of smoke. The spectators waited in
breathless suspense, for a few seconds, for the
explosion. Soon it came; and then every sleeper
started to his feet. Orders were issued to put out
all fires, and for every one to be equipped, and
ready for action at a moment’s notice. It was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
general opinion that there would be a brush with
the enemy, if not a pitched battle; and the men
were quiet, but determined. But the morning
wore away without an alarm; and, at ten o’clock,
the line was formed, and the column headed for
Baton Rouge, in which direction the wagon-train
had already moved. The troops were in ill-humor,
the whole movement seeming incomprehensible to
them. Soon <ins class="corr" id="tn-55" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'an aid from the'">
an aide from the</ins> commander-in-chief
rode up to Col. Gooding with an order, requesting
him to announce to the third brigade that the
“Hartford” and the “Albatross” had passed the
batteries of Port Hudson, and that “the object of
the expedition had been accomplished.” Gradually,
the men recovered their accustomed spirits;
and when Gen. Banks rode by the column he was
heartily cheered. On the march back, the carcasses
in the fields showed that the reserve brigade
had been “living on the country.” The pontoon
bridge was reached before night, but was not
crossed, the brigade marching into the woods near
the road, where they stacked arms and pitched
tents. Soon after dark, it began to rain heavily,
and the camping-ground became a swamp, while
the water came through the new shelters, leaving
few dry soldiers in camp that night. The next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
day, at noon, another expedition was undertaken.
The roads were in a bad condition, and, in many
places, it was necessary to go in single file, to
escape being mired. After a four-mile march, a
halt was made in a clearing, where the command
remained during the night, ready to spring to arms
at a moment’s notice, and, the next day, marched
back to the bayou.</p>

<p>Friday, the line was again formed, and the brigade
marched into Baton Rouge, and through the
city to a magnolia grove, a mile beyond. The
place was alive with mosquitoes, wood-ticks, and
similar insects, and the nimble lizards glided about,
making themselves familiar; but the men were too
weary to study natural history, and were soon
sleeping soundly, in spite of such annoyances.
The next day was devoted to bathing, washing
clothes, and resting. On Sunday morning (22d),
the regiment started again; and, after marching
through all the swamps, cane-fields, and hedges,
bounding that part of the town, halted in one of
the most forbidding looking spots in Baton Rouge,
about a mile from the river, near the “Perkins
Road.” A camp was laid out, company streets
staked off, and fatigue parties detailed to clear
away the rubbish, dig up the stumps, and fill the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
bog-holes. The tents were pitched just in time to
afford partial shelter from a rain-storm. The men
at this time had the impression that Sunday was
the day especially selected in the Nineteenth Army
Corps, on which to begin new movements, or do
extra fatigue duty. In a day or two, the regimental
and company baggage that had been
packed was returned, and the A tents again
pitched.</p>

<p>Saturday, March 29th, the regiment took its turn
at chopping down the forests in the vicinity of
Baton Rouge, so that the guns from the fort might
have a free range, in case of an attack from the
enemy. Some could use the axe professionally;
and all tried their hands on the lofty oaks, beeches,
and magnolias, whose fall resounded through the
forest, until the sound of the recall, at four o’clock,
when the regiment returned to camp, tired, but in
great good-humor. Drill was resumed, and the
old routine of camp duties began; but this did not
last long, however; for the first day of April found
the regiment on board of a transport, again steaming
down the Mississippi. Landing at Algiers
(opposite the city of New Orleans), a new camp
was laid out, the tents again pitched, and drilling
went on as usual. Regiments continued to arrive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
every day; and soon the plains of Algiers were
white with the tents of Emory’s division.</p>

<p>Here, for the first time since its organization,
the regimental camp-guard was dispensed with,
and the men allowed a little liberty to look
around, and see the country they were fighting
for. That they did not abuse the confidence thus
reposed in them by their officers, may be inferred
from the fact, that no regimental guard was placed
around the Thirty Eighth after that time; and
when other regiments were confined to strict camp-limits,
Lieut.-Col. Richardson allowed his command,
when off duty, to roam anywhere within
sound of the bugle, and, when stationed near a
town or city, freely gave leave of absence when it
did not conflict with orders from higher authorities.</p>

<p>At this time, the Forty Seventh Massachusetts
was doing garrison duty in New Orleans, and,
having many acquaintances in the Thirty Eighth,
visited them often. The contrast between the
nicely-fitting, home-made uniforms of the Forty
Seventh boys, and the shoddy affairs furnished by
the contractors to the Thirty Eighth, was a source
of much amusement to the members of the latter
regiment. In the field, clothing was a matter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
little importance; but when a haversack strap or
a knapsack buckle broke at the beginning of a
long march, or the sole came off a shoe at a slight
stumble, which very often happened, the comments
on the patriotism of those who provided for the
wants of the army were more expressive than elegant.</p>

<p>Although New Orleans and Algiers had been in
the Union hands for over a year, the feeling was
still bitter toward the North. The following incident
will illustrate this feeling. The day before
Easter, the writer of this sketch had a few hours
of leisure, and was strolling through the streets
looking at the objects of interest, when, passing
a small church, the sound of Easter hymns floated
out on the air. Not having been inside of a
church for many months, the sweet music brought
memories of home to the mind; and, stepping
noiselessly inside, he stood near the door, listening
respectfully. The choir was engaged in a rehearsal,
under the direction of a gentleman whose
white cravat and clerical air bespoke the minister.
Suddenly, the singers caught sight of the blue
uniform, and the music instantly ceased. Upon
following the direction of their glances, the clergyman
cast what he evidently intended to be a withering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
look on the unwelcome spectator. A silence
of a few moments ensued, when the soldier asked
if he was intruding. “Yes,” was the reply, in a
very curt tone. Apologizing for the unintentional
intrusion, the visitor retreated, followed to the door
by the chivalrous clergyman, who probably took
precautions to prevent his choir from being shocked
by the presence of any more blue uniforms, while
singing the anthems of “Peace on earth, and good
will to men.”</p>

<p>Labor being scarce in Algiers, several regiments
were called upon to furnish fatigue parties to assist
in raising a gun-boat on the ways in the dry-dock;
and, on the 8th of April, the Thirty Eighth
took their turn, and completed the task.</p>

<p>The regimental baggage was again packed away;
and all personal property, with the exception of a
rubber blanket, overcoat, and change of clothing
to each man, was packed in the knapsacks, and
nailed up in large boxes; and at two o’clock, on
the morning of the 9th, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">reveillé</span> woke the
sleeping camp, the tents were struck, and, by
seven o’clock, the regiment was on board of the
cars, bound for the interior of Louisiana. For
eighty miles, the road ran through a low, swampy
country. The ditches beside the embankment on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
which the track was laid were full of alligators,
who swam lazily through the green, stagnant
waters, or basked in the sun on the banks; nearly
every floating log or stick was tenanted by a repulsive
water-moccasin; and frogs of huge proportions
plumped into the water as the train went by.
These specimens of the animate life of Louisiana
were regarded with much interest by the regiment,
as they were to be intimate neighbors, possibly,
in the future.</p>

<p>The line of road was guarded by New York
and Connecticut regiments; and their post did
not appear to be an enviable one. A little after
noon, the train arrived at Brashear City. The
place was full of troops; and others were continually
arriving in the cars or on foot, and crossing
the bay to Berwick City. The Thirty Eighth
formed in line, the sick-call was blown, and another
examination held; and all those who were
considered unable to keep up with the column
were kept behind, to do light guard-duty. Some
who had been foremost in every duty were left
here, much to their regret. After waiting for an
hour or two, the regiment embarked on the gun-boat
“Clinton,” and was transported across Berwick
Bay to Berwick City, accompanied by Gen.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
Banks and staff, and the shelter-tents pitched in a
level field, where the clover was ankle-deep. A
large force was collected here, the troops of
Emory’s division being joined to the veterans
of Weitzel, who had already achieved victory in
this vicinity.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the 11th of April, the division broke
camp, and moved out on the main road
toward Centreville; the gun-boats shelling
the woods from the bayou, and the cavalry
scouting in advance. Co. F was detached,
and ordered to remain behind to guard a
bridge on the line of the railroad, to prevent raids
on the rear, while the army moved on.</p>

<p>The rebels were reported to be in large force
near Pattersonville, under the command of Gen.
Dick Taylor, determined to stop the advance of the
Union troops through this portion of the Confederacy;
and they were reported to have erected strong
fortifications at Camp Bisland.</p>

<p>After a dusty march over the turnpike, feeling
its way along, the army went into camp beyond
Pattersonville; and soon the camp-fires were blazing
for miles around, lighting up the country, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
giving the enemy warning of the approach of the
Union forces.</p>

<p>Co. F remained in its position, crouching behind
the brakes, and occasionally throwing sticks
at the alligators in the ditches, and all the while
keeping a sharp look-out for the rebel pickets
ahead, until four o’clock, when it crossed the
bridge, and struck out for the army. Just beyond
the bridge, a letter was picked up, addressed to a
woman in Texas, and bearing Confederate postage-stamps.
It purported to have been written on
picket that day, and gave a statement of the number
of Confederate troops in the vicinity, with some
account of the movements of the Union forces. It
was well written, but had probably been dropped on
purpose, with the intention of misleading. Night
found the company marching through the woods,
the rebel picket-posts by the roadside giving evidence
of having been occupied quite recently. No
one in the company was acquainted with the road;
and the chances were even of bringing up in either
camp; but the orders were peremptory to join the
regiment in the evening. After a march of several
hours, sometimes by the flank, sometimes in
single file, through ditches, hedges, and swamps,
the camp-fires of an army appeared in sight.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
Doubtful whether it were friend or foe, Captain
Rundlet sent out reconnoiterers, who soon ascertained
that all was right, and the company
marched into the camp of the Second Rhode
Island Cavalry. The regiment was a mile further
on, encamped in a cane-field, beyond Pattersonville.</p>

<p>The owner of the plantation had fled; but many
of the negroes still remained, and were soon at
work making corn-cakes for the soldiers, out of
massa’s meal.</p>

<p>About noon, the army advanced in line of battle.
The march was through a cane-field, the canes still
standing; and, as they grew thick and strong, it
became difficult to keep a proper line. The batteries
were moving up to the front, shelling the
woods as they advanced; and a rifle-shot would be
occasionally heard. After marching in this manner
for two miles, the regiment halted for several
hours, the cannonading still continuing. Between
three and four o’clock, it was announced that the
fighting was over for the day, and the march was
resumed; but it was suddenly stopped by the
breaking out afresh of the artillery fire. Laying
on the ground, in cover of the standing cane,
the regiment witnessed a sharp artillery engagement.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
A large sugar-mill had been set on fire,
and the flames soon spread to the surrounding
cabins. The bursting of the shells, the volumes of
flame and smoke issuing from the mill, the sharp
crack of the rifle, the <ins class="corr" id="tn-66" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'galloping of aids'">
galloping of aides</ins> over the
field with orders, and the bayonets glistening over
the tops of the canes, as the brigades manœuvred
over the field, was a new experience to the Thirty
Eighth. The firing lasted about an hour, gradually
ceasing as the batteries fell back; the position of
the enemy having been ascertained, and the object
of the reconnoissance accomplished. Fires were not
allowed, and the men went without their coffee for
the first time. Equipments were kept on, and the
regiment bivouacked in rear of the stacks. In the
evening, a call was made for sharpshooters, to pick
off the gunners of the Diana, in case she should
come down the bayou; and the number required
reported at once. There was no alarm during the
night; and, in the morning, the army again moved
forward. A bridge had been thrown across the
bayou; and the third brigade crossed over, a rebel
shell occasionally dropping into the water, near the
bridge, sending up the spray, and facilitating the
passage of the troops, who wished to do their fighting
on firmer footing than the swaying bridge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
afforded. The artillery were at work on both sides,
and it was evident that the long-expected battle
was about to take place. While the brigade was
getting into line, after having crossed the stream,
Gens. Banks and Emory passed, and were enthusiastically
greeted. Marching up the road, the
brigade filed into a cane-field, in front of a portion
of the rebel works. The Thirty First Massachusetts
were in advance, the Thirty Eighth
following, with the Fifty Third Massachusetts in
the rear; and the One Hundred and Fifty Sixth
New York were sent toward the woods on the
right. The cane-field was intersected with broad,
deep ditches, now entirely dry, and their sides
lined with blackberry bushes. The Thirty First
deployed, and moved forward in a skirmish-line
part way across the field, until within gunshot
of the enemy, when they halted in one of the
ditches, and began to fire, the rebels occasionally
returning the shots, from behind the breastworks.
The Thirty First retained their position during the
forenoon, losing two or three men, who were carried
to the rear past the Thirty Eighth, which
remained in reserve, picking blackberries, watching
the fight, and getting their ears accustomed to the
shrieking of the shells, and the discharges of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
musketry. The One Hundred and Fifty Sixth, in
the meantime, were gradually working their way
into the woods on the right flank. The heavy
firing on the left of the bayou told that the other
brigades were also at work.</p>

<p>While Gen. Emory’s division and Weitzel’s brigade
were confronting the enemy, and engaging
their attention, Gen. Grover’s division, which had
crossed the country through the La Fourche district,
was endeavoring to come in their rear, and
thus, by enclosing them between the two portions
of the army, cut off all retreat, and compel the
surrender of the entire force. Having this programme
in view, it had not been the policy of Gen.
Banks to bring on a decisive engagement until
Grover was ready to “close up the bag.”</p>

<p>At noon, the ammunition of the Thirty First
being exhausted, it was relieved by the Thirty
Eighth. This position was occupied but a short
time, when the order was given to advance. Keeping
the exact distance they had been taught in
the drill, in a well-dressed skirmish-line, the men
moved steadily toward the breastworks. The right
companies soon began to receive shots from the
woods; but were instructed not to fire in that direction,
as the One Hundred and Fifty Sixth held<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
the position. Obeying orders, they reserved their
fire until the rebel gunners were plainly visible
working the batteries. A piece of cane had been
left standing near the line of earthworks; and, just
before the advance reached its cover, the rebels
opened a rapid fire of artillery and musketry. The
skirmishers were ordered to lie down, while the
shells and bullets screamed and whistled over their
heads. But they were not long inactive. Taking
advantage of stumps, ditches, furrows, and canes,
they poured a rapid fire into the enemy’s works.
The gunners were picked off; and the traditional
“officer on the white horse” was made an especial
target. While the right was more exposed
to the enemy’s rifles, the centre and left suffered
from their artillery, the colors being a prominent
mark. Color-corporal Trow, of Co. D, was instantly
killed by a solid shot; and Cos. A and
G suffered particularly from shells. By one of
these explosions, Capt. Gault, of the former company,
had his leg badly shattered, and died in a
few hours; and a number of men were wounded.</p>

<p>The battle lasted all day on both sides of the
bayou. As evening drew near, the ammunition of
the Thirty Eighth gave out. Many men had fired
all their cartridges, and were trying to borrow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
from their more economical comrades. The
wounded had been taken to the rear, and attended
to in the field hospital. And now the Fifty
Third came forward, and relieved the Thirty
Eighth, who fell slowly back under fire, till they
reached the place selected as quarters for the
night,—a deep, dry ditch, near the centre of the
field. Of course, no fires were allowed, and supper
was made of hard-tack and water.</p>

<p>Partly filling the ditch with dry canes, and
wrapping their blankets around them, with the
guns of the First Maine Battery beating the tattoo
a few yards in their rear, the men laid down,
their rifles by their side, and their equipments on,
ready to fall in line at the first call. Contrary to
expectation, there was no alarm during the night.
In the morning, a portion of the field was searched
for missing men. Thomas W. Hevey, of Co. I,
was brought in, dead, the stem of his pipe firmly
fixed in his teeth. He was smoking when struck
by the fatal bullet, and fell on his face. During
the engagement, six had been killed and thirty
wounded, a complete list of whom will be found
in another portion of the work.</p>

<p>Fires were now allowed to be built, and coffee
made, after which the regiment moved forward in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
line. The Fifty Third had remained all night in
the front, and its flags were seen near the works,
the regiment advancing in line of battle. The
Thirty First was also moving on. All was quiet
behind the earthworks; and soon the report came
that the enemy had evacuated their position during
the night, and were in full retreat, three miles
ahead. At this time, Gen. Grover was supposed
by the men to have cut off all retreat, and the army
was in excellent spirits at the anticipated bagging
of the whole force; but it was soon learned that
a hole had been left, and the slippery foe had
wriggled out of it. Crossing the cane-field, the
Thirty Eighth entered the rebel works. The killed
and wounded men had been removed; but the
dead horses scattered about gave evidence of the
accuracy of the aim of the brigade in this its
maiden fight. The camp-fires were still smouldering
inside of the works; and the remains of the
hasty breakfast of roasted ears of corn gave proof
that the rebels had not been long gone. Skirmishing
a short distance through the woods beyond the
fortifications, and finding no enemy, the line was
again formed, and the brigade moved by the flank
along the road, until further progress was stopped
by a bayou, the bridge over which had been partially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
burned, and was still smoking. Here an
abandoned caisson was fished out of the stream,
the first trophy of the victory. The pioneers soon
repaired the bridge, and the column passed over,
and halted a few hours, while the artillery and the
wagon-train were brought across.</p>

<p>It was a long, weary march that Gen. Dick
Taylor led the Army of the Gulf through this
country of bayous and plantations. Had there
been a respectable cavalry force in the department,
but few of those who fought behind the fortifications
of Bisland would have reached Alexandria;
but the delay caused in repairing bridges prevented
the Union army from coming up with its
foes, and the majority of them escaped, although
completely demoralized, and deprived of the power
of acting on the offensive for several months.</p>

<p>An amusing incident occurred just after the
march was resumed. A man, apparently dressed
in gray uniform, was seen running across a corn-field,
toward the woods. Although many hundred
yards off, a number of rifles were instantly
levelled at him, and the <ins class="corr" id="tn-72" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'minnies went whistling'">
minies went whistling</ins> on their errand. He hesitated for a moment,
and then started on again, when another discharge
took place, and the dust was seen to fly near the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
mark. Making frantic signals, he faced about,
and came toward the road. A nearer inspection
proved him to be a harmless contraband, in the
usual plantation suit. The fighting of the day
before had given the boys a liking for the sound
of their Enfields; and probably every gun in the
regiment would have been discharged if the fugitive
had not halted. The poor fellow, no doubt,
came to the conclusion that the “day of jubilo”
had not yet come.</p>

<p>The heat was intense during the day, and
the men suffered a good deal from the dust and
from thirst, many falling out. But the commanding
general wished to give the enemy no time to
throw up intrenchments. Barely halting long
enough for a hasty lunch at noon, the column
pushed on. A little while after dark, the brigade
passed through the pretty town of Franklin, and
went into camp in a cane-field. No one thought
of pitching tents, or of cooking coffee. Eating a
few hard-tack, and washing it down with bayou
water, each man (except the unfortunate guard)
selected as level a furrow as convenient, spread
his rubber, and was soon enjoying a well-earned
rest. Just as the men had settled themselves for
the night, the commissary sergeant came around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
with the information that fresh meat was ready.
It was left on the ground for the benefit of the
plantation hands who swarmed in the rear of the
army.</p>

<p>Wednesday morning, April 18, the column
moved at six o’clock, the Thirty Eighth on the
right of the brigade, making the marching a little
easier than on the day before. The country
through which the army was now passing, known
as the Tèche district, was considered the richest
part of Louisiana previous to the war. Unable to
get their crops to market, the sugar and cotton-houses
were filled to overflowing. Large herds of
cattle fed in the pastures, and the woods were full
of hogs. Nearly all of the able-bodied young men
were in the Confederate army; and, at the approach
of the Union troops, the old planters
fled to the woods in many instances, and hid
until the column had passed by. No Northern
soldiers had been seen in that country before;
and the long lines of infantry, the numerous batteries,
and the immense wagon-trains, were a
source of never-ending wonder to the crowds of
slaves, who flocked to the roadsides and climbed
the fences to see Massa Linkum’s boys. “Bress
de Lord! We’se been lookin’ for ye dese twenty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
years, and ye’re come at last!” exclaimed one
well-developed old lady, who, clothed in a very
short dress, very full pants, and a broad plantation
hat, had mounted on a high rail-fence to get a good
look at the Yankee soldiers. These poor people
had little means with which to gratify their desires
to serve those whom they looked upon as friends;
yet many of them baked their last mess of meal
into corn-cake for the hungry soldiers. The few
white men that were seen in this region had the
appearance of having just thrown the musket
aside, with the intention of resuming it again
as soon as the army passed, and before the sun-marks
should fade from their faces.</p>

<p>On many of the houses, English and French
flags were flying; the inmates thinking their property
might be more secure by claiming foreign protection.
During the entire march, private property
was respected to a degree never before shown
by an army in an enemy’s country; and guards
were placed over many of the houses of prominent
rebels. It is true that less regard was shown to
the occupants of a poorer class of houses; and the
immense number of contrabands attached to the
Army of the Gulf, in the capacity of officers’ servants,
were not very scrupulous, and generally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
came into camp at night pretty well laden with
poultry and vegetables; but, as their labor had
produced these articles, perhaps they were entitled
to them. An indiscriminate liberty to forage would
have been fatal to the efficiency of the army, and
might have defeated the object of the campaign.
Thus, while there was comparatively little foraging
carried on, these foreign flags were no safeguard.
If an unlucky chicken or pig had happened in
the way, he would have been gobbled up, if he had
borne the private mark of Victoria or Napoleon.</p>

<p>Thursday night, the army went into camp before
dark, beyond the village of Indian Bend. The
country hitherto had been perfectly level, and,
previous to the war, was mostly devoted to the
culture of sugar; but, in accordance with the advice
of the Confederate leaders, many of the plantations
were now planted with corn.</p>

<p>On Friday, the aspect of the country changed,
and rolling prairies succeeded to the low plains.
Herds of cattle roamed over these prairies; the
view of which caused some lively comments on
the starving-out theory indulged in by some of
the good people at home. Saturday, April 18,
the entire force rested. It had been a full week
since leaving Berwick City; and the troops had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
been marching or fighting continuously, sleeping
nearly every night with their equipments on. In
addition to this, each regiment furnished its proportion
of the picket; and, after a march of from
twenty to thirty miles, those detailed had to sling
their bundles again, go off half a mile or a mile
into the woods, and keep awake part of the night,
peering into the darkness, and making their supper
of hard-tack and water. It may, perhaps, be imagined
how welcome this day of rest was to both
man and beast, under these circumstances.</p>

<p>A fine head of cattle was confiscated here;
and a large portion of the day spent in feasting.
In fact, there was no lack of fresh meat during
the entire march through this country; but, as it
was brought into camp generally after the men
had quartered for the night, little of it was cooked.
And then this was the first year in the field, and
that experience had not been acquired which makes
the difference between raw recruits and veterans.</p>

<p>Sunday morning, the 19th, the army was again
in motion. The line was just forming, when the
clouds opened, and the rain and hail came down
in a manner peculiar to Louisiana. In a few minutes,
every one was wet to the skin; and, in this
state, a long day’s march began. The cavalry and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
artillery cut up the roads, so that the infantry
went into the soft mud to the ankles at every step.
During the day, the army marched through the
village of Lafayetteville, in which nearly every
house had a white rag hung out as a token of
peace. These people had heard such stories of the
Union army, that they looked upon its approach
with terror and apprehension; but the men who
enlisted in ’61 and ’62 were no desperadoes, and
did not make war on women and children. That
night, the brigade encamped on a piece of grassland,
and found it much preferable to the usual
cane-field furrows. Starting again in the morning
(April 20), a wide, shallow stream was reached,
which had to be forded. The horses went over
first, making numerous holes in the soft bottom;
and it was an amusing sight to see the infantry
feel their way cautiously along, half sliding, half
walking, some unfortunate individual occasionally
missing his footing, and plunging headlong into
the muddy stream.</p>

<p>About four o’clock, <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, the bugles sounded a
halt, and an aide rode down from the front with an
order to the effect, that Opelousas, the Confederate
capital of the State, had surrendered unconditionally.
This important announcement was received<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
with cheers; the ranks closed up; the colors were
unfurled; the drums beat; and, with a proud step,
the column marched on. Passing a few scattering
houses, the open country was again reached, when
the inquiries became numerous as to the whereabouts
of the capital. It was learned that the
army had marched through one of the principal
streets. This was not the first time they had been
deceived by an imposing name bestowed upon a
handful of buildings; but it was hardly worth
while to make a parade of surrendering this little
clearing, if the travelling government of the State
did make a transient stay there.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">TAYLOR’S force had by this time become
completely demoralized and broken up,
and a portion of it captured; there was
no longer any fear of its assuming the
offensive; and the army remained in camp
until the 5th of May, while plans were being
matured for the continuance of the campaign.
Great inconvenience was experienced here from
the scarcity of wood and water. Beginning with
the nearest fences, the cooks and their assistants
had gradually laid bare the fields beyond the
picket-line. A muddy pond near the camp furnished
a portion of the water, until the horses refused
to drink it, when the men gave it up, and
brought water from the wells, at a great distance.
While laying here, long trains of wagons daily
passed in sight of the camp, laden with cotton;
and many of the volunteers, who had been accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
to think for themselves, and still held that
privilege in reserve, were of the opinion, that if the
teams had been employed, under regularly organized
fatigue parties, in bringing sweet potatoes and
other vegetables into the camps, a more efficient
force might have been taken to Port Hudson, and
the country better served than in collecting cotton,
even for its own benefit.</p>

<p>During the halt at Opelousas, a series of complimentary
orders were read to the troops on
parade, from Gens. Banks, Emory, and the brigade
commander, Col. Gooding, congratulating
them on their success, and expressing confidence
in the successful prosecution of the campaign.</p>

<p>On the 24th, the division was reviewed by
Gens. Banks and Emory. The first brigade (Col.
Ingraham’s) had been broken up, and the regiments
composing it stationed at the various important
posts between Brashear and Opelousas; so
that there were present only eleven regiments of
infantry, two batteries, and some squadrons of cavalry.
The Fourth Wisconsin made its first appearance
at this review as cavalry. Mounted on
horses and mules of every description, with most
primitive and unique equipments, it excited considerable
merriment, and gave little promise of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
great reputation it afterwards attained,—the pride
of the Army of the Gulf, and the terror of the
rebels of Louisiana.</p>

<p>At this time, an order was issued by the brigade
commander, forbidding officers to address the men
as “boys,” saying that they were men in every
sense of the word, and should be so styled at all
times. The “boys” laughed at this new idea:
the custom was too deep-seated in the service to be
eradicated by a brigade order. The mails did not
reach the regiment very often; and there were all
kinds of rumors in regard to matters in the world
outside. The announcement of the fall of Charleston
was received with mingled cheers and expressions
of doubt.</p>

<p>Monday night, May 4, an order was read on
parade, announcing the arrival at Baton Rouge
of a cavalry force under Col. Grierson, after a
successful raid through the State of Mississippi.
The news of this achievement was received with
pleasure by the Army of the Gulf, as showing
that the heavy drain on the fighting men of the
South had begun to show itself by the defenceless
state of that portion of the Confederacy away from
the immediate vicinity of the chief rebel armies.</p>

<p>There was but little drilling at Opelousas, the intense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
heat during the greater part of the time,
making officers and men alike glad to seek the
shade. Capt. Doten, of Co. G, resigned his commission
at this time, and made a farewell address
to the regiment before taking his leave. On the
30th, the regiment was mustered for pay; and
Tuesday morning, the 5th of May, found it again
on the march. Passing through the little town
of Washington, about six miles from Opelousas,
the route lay through a rich cotton and sugar section;
but the greater portion of the land was now
planted with corn, the rebels having learned that
Cotton was no longer king. Marching for miles
through these immense fields of corn, growing rapidly
under the Louisiana sun, the men of the
Thirty Eighth were amused at the ponderous articles
which occasionally reached them in some of
the Northern journals, demonstrating how easy it
would be to starve the South into submission.</p>

<p>The roads began to be very dusty, and oftentimes
the water was poor and scarce; but the
army kept on its way, day after day, the men
dragging themselves into camp at night, with
blistered feet, and too tired to cook the fresh
meat regularly issued. For four days, this forced
marching was continued, barely stopping long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
enough at noon to boil a dipper of coffee. On the
8th of May, when a few miles from Alexandria,
news came, that the gun-boats of Admiral Porter
had reached that town, and that it was in possession
of the navy. After a long halt at noon, the
regiments unrolled their flags, the bands uncovered
their instruments, and the army marched
into the town in good order, to music which had
become strange to this portion of the Union, and
which was heard by the residents with no emotions
of pleasure. The faces of the citizens wore that
same expression of mingled bitterness and curiosity
that had been noticed in Franklin, Opelousas,
and Washington; and even the little children
seemed to think it no pageant in which they
should take delight. Marching through the town,
the brigade went into camp on a level grass-plat,
near the banks of the Red River.</p>

<p>By order of Gen. Emory, drills were dispensed
with at Alexandria, and “every opportunity given
the men to recover from the fatigues of the recent
march, and prepare for the active duties still before
them.” The river was alive with bathers
daily; and its banks were lined with busy washermen.
Gun-boats and transports steamed up and
down the river, giving a lively appearance to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
place; but business, other than military and naval,
was stagnant.</p>

<p>On the 14th, marching orders were received.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">reveillé</span> was beaten at two o’clock, <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, the
next morning (Friday); but the Thirty Eighth
having the position of rear-guard, did not move until
daylight. There had been heavy showers the
day previous, turning the dust into mud, and the
progress was slow. Still twenty miles were made,
the army going into camp occupied by them on the
upward march, on the banks of a bayou.</p>

<p>The next morning, the third brigade had the
centre of the column, and the marching was easier.
The old road was followed as far as the village of
Cheneyville, when the route changed, and the army
turned again toward the Red River. That night,
the regiment camped in a cane-field near a large
sugar-mill, stored with more than one year’s crop.
The troops were liberally supplied with sugar by
order of the division commander, the neighboring
fields supplied adventurous foragers with new potatoes,
and the plantation ditches were full of
ripe blackberries; so that, with the fresh meat
issued by the quartermaster, the regiment fared
unusually well, and long remembered the bivouac
by the old mill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>A short march was made the next day, the army
going into camp at nine o’clock, near Simmsport,
on the Atchafalaya River. There, to the great joy
of every one, a large mail, both of letters and papers,
was received; and the regiment once more
learned how the world outside was moving. Tuesday
morning, May 19, the troops were ferried across
the Atchafalaya, and encamped on the other side,
with the expectation of remaining several days;
but Thursday morning saw the inevitable “orderly”
ride into camp, and the column was again in
motion.</p>

<p>For the past month, the weather had been rapidly
growing warmer, the roads more dusty, and
the swamp and bayou water on the line of march
more unpalatable; and the regiment parted with
regret from the clear Atchafalaya, with its green,
shady banks, and its beautiful scenery.</p>

<p>A portion of the country in this vicinity having
been flooded by breaks in the levee, the progress
was slow; the artillery and wagons being obliged
to go on top of the embankment raised to keep
back the waters of the Old River,—a former bed
of the Mississippi. The regiment went into camp
about dark, in a woods, beyond a small town, and
starting again at daylight, during the forenoon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
reached the Mississippi, at Morganza Bend. De
Soto and his Spaniards greeted the mighty river
with no more enthusiasm on its discovery than did
the dusty and thirsty Army of the Gulf when it
once more came in view. Its muddy waters were
eagerly sipped, and the canteens filled for future
use.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AT Morganza, the army found transports
awaiting to take it across the river.
A sail of fourteen miles brought the
steamers to Bayou Sara, where the troops
were disembarked, and rations issued.
This village had seen fit to harbor the
guerillas, who, from their ambush, had fired alike
on vessels of war and peaceful river-boats; and it
bore the marks of the prompt punishment inflicted
by the gun-boats. Solitary chimneys arose
from heaps of rubbish which marked the spots
where once houses and places of business had
rested secure under the old flag; and a general
air of lifelessness and decay pervaded the place.</p>

<p>The regiment had scarcely begun the ascent of
the steep bluff overlooking the village, when one
of the sudden storms peculiar to the Valley of the
Mississippi, broke over them; and in a few minutes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
they were not only wet through, but the deep
red soil was so saturated, that marching became
almost impossible. Passing through the village
of St. Francisville, the brigade encamped at night
near a cotton-press, and built huge fires, around
which the men grouped till partially dry; the
picket detail, however, going to their posts wet
and supperless, but without complaint.</p>

<p>The next morning, upon the arrival of Mack’s
Black Horse Battery (Eighteenth New York), the
column moved toward Port Hudson. The road
was bordered on each side by a high hedge, which
shut out all air, and made the heat very oppressive;
and it was gratifying, upon emerging into the
open country, to find a broad, shallow stream, with
a clean, pebbly bottom directly in the line of march.
It was easily forded by the infantry, but the artillery
and wagons caused some delay. While waiting
for the batteries to cross the stream, a body of
cavalry rode by, which proved to be the famed command
of Col. Grierson, whose great raid through
Mississippi was the forerunner of the exploits of
Sheridan, Stoneman, and Kilpatrick. Gen. Banks
and staff also rode by; and the cheering news was
announced that a connection had been made with
the division of Gen. Augur, which had marched up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
from Baton Rouge, and that Port Hudson was
completely surrounded, and its fall a matter of
time only.</p>

<p>Sunday, May 24, the regiment enjoyed a rest,
merely changing camp once. On the 25th, the
Thirty Eighth leaving the brigade, marched to
Sandy Creek, on the extreme right of the line; and
several of the companies deployed as skirmishers
near the creek, the enemy firing across the stream
from the opposite side. In this skirmish, two men
were killed, and two wounded.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, two native Louisiana regiments
arrived at the creek; and the Thirty Eighth had an
opportunity to witness the behavior of the first colored
troops under fire in this war. A great deal
of romance has been spoken and printed about this
affair; but, without wishing to detract in the least
from the really valuable services rendered by the
colored troops during the siege, especially in the engineer’s
department, it may be doubted if the exaggerated
accounts of their bravery were of any
real benefit to the “colored boys in blue.”</p>

<p>It had been the fashion for so long a time to decry
the courage of the colored man, and deny him
all the attributes of manhood, that, when he proved
himself something more than a beast of burden,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
public opinion went to the opposite extreme; and
men who had been for years boasting of the superiority
of the Northern over the Southern races,
and quoting all history to prove it, now asserted
that this new freedman was the equal, if not the
superior, of the Northern volunteer. It was even
reported that Gen. Banks had said that the colored
soldiers went where the white ones dared not go;
and although this was an improbable story, it injured
the general’s popularity, and increased
the prejudice already existing against the colored
troops in the Thirteenth and Nineteenth Corps.</p>

<p>The regiment remained near Sandy Creek during
the next day, supporting the battery, while
the colored regiments were at work building a
bridge. On the night of the 26th, there were
two alarms, caused by the stampeding of mules;
and the Thirty Eighth received a volley from one
of the colored regiments, who thought the enemy
were making a cavalry raid; but, owing to the
high range taken, the bullets whistled harmlessly
over head, and the panic soon subsided.</p>

<p>During the Tèche campaign, Co. E had held the
honorable position of head-quarter guard for Gen.
Emory, and had seldom encamped near the regiment;
but upon the withdrawal of that general to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
New Orleans, the company returned to its proper
position in the Thirty Eighth, and shared in all the
labors of the siege.</p>

<p>Wednesday morning, the regiment received orders
to join its brigade, which had been engaged,
farther on the left, in driving the enemy from the
woods, and into his works. The Thirty First had
been prominent in this skirmishing, and had lost a
number of men.</p>

<p>The battle began early on the morning of the
27th; and as the Thirty Eighth drew near the
front, on the double-quick, the wounded men were
already being carried to the rear, and the surgeons
of the various regiments were arranging their instruments
on the temporary tables put up in the
fields, not entirely out of reach of wandering shells.
The sight of the glittering instruments was suggestive;
but there was no time for foreboding.</p>

<p>While the Thirty Eighth was hunting in the
woods for the brigade, Gen. Paine rode up, and
sent it forward to support Duryea’s Battery, which
he had just placed in position on the edge of the
woods, in front of the rebel works. Taking cover
in rear of the guns, the regiment awaited events,
having enthusiastically promised Gen. Paine to
stand by the battery at all hazards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>The artillery directed a heavy fire upon the fortifications
from various points, dismounting cannon,
and blowing up caissons; the skirmishers had
worked their way up to the ditch in front of the
breastworks, and were seen running up the embankment;
and the fire from the enemy had almost
ceased. It was generally believed that the
outer line of works had been abandoned; and the
regiment, issuing from the rear of the battery,
formed in line of battle, and charged on the double-quick;
but, on account of the ravines and fallen
timber on each side of the roadway, the line of
battle could not be maintained, and the order was
given, “by the right flank,” which movement was
immediately executed. Another regiment was in
advance, and through some misapprehension, did
not go forward, causing the two commands to be
mixed up, the colors being nearly side by side.</p>

<p>By this time, the breastworks were fully manned,
and a volley of musketry met the advancing column;
but there was no hesitation, when, to the
surprise of the regiment, the order came to “lie
down.” Accustomed to obey orders promptly, the
men dropped at once, some in the roadway, others
in the ravines to the right and left. And now the
enemy had it all their own way. Safe behind their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
works, they took deliberate aim at every man in that
exposed position who showed signs of life. Lieut.
Col. Rodman, rising to give or receive an order,
was struck in the breast by a bullet, and fell lifeless,
the command then devolving upon Capt. Wyman,
of Co. B. For hours, the men in the roadway
remained beneath the scorching sun, suffering
for want of water, and knowing that the least
movement would be the signal for a death-messenger
from the enemy; yet, notwithstanding the constant
artillery and musketry fire, men slept soundly
at times. During the afternoon, the dry brush
and trees in the ravines took fire, adding to the intense
heat, and driving portions of the troops to
seek new cover. The assault on other portions of
the line had been equally unsuccessful, and the
casualties still larger, an unusual number of commanding
officers being among the killed; but the
ground was held; and, before night, the men had
acquired such a knowledge of the position, and
availed themselves so thoroughly of every advantage
afforded by the ravines, that it was unsafe for
a rebel to show his head above the breastworks.</p>

<p>The casualties in the Thirty Eighth had been
few, considering the severe fire to which it was
exposed; and the rebels must have discharged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
their muskets at random. There had been three
killed and fourteen wounded.</p>

<p>The regiment remained on the field through the
night, the dead and wounded having been taken to
the rear before dark. A few extracts from letters
written at the time, may perhaps give a better idea
of the events that transpired within the following
week, with the impressions of the men, the rumors,
etc., than any more formal account:</p>

<p>“Thursday, May, 28.... The rebels opened
fire this morning from their batteries, and ours replied,
blowing up a caisson of ammunition inside of
the works. A flag of truce was put up soon after,
and the firing ceased. Both sides have been burying
the dead this forenoon; and we have been
lying in the ravine, near the works, the sun coming
down hot. The truce will be up at two o’clock,
I believe, when the battle will probably begin again.</p>

<p>“Friday morning, 29th. The flag of truce was
up till seven o’clock last night. There was perfect
quiet along the entire line; and officers and men
were scattered over the field, looking for the dead
and wounded, and gazing at the works in front of
us. Two companies of the One Hundred and Sixtieth
New York were in the ditch in front of the
works; and the rebels occasionally looked over,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
and chatted with them. We understood that the
long truce was on account of some negotiations;
the rebels offering to surrender the place if allowed
to march out with military honors. These terms
were not accepted, and the truce was to terminate
at seven. Just before that hour, we received orders
to keep under cover, as the battle was to commence
as soon as the flags were withdrawn. We
watched the little white signals closely. Ours was
taken down, and then that of the enemy was withdrawn.
In a few minutes, the ball opened on our
side, and, for about an hour, the roar of cannon
and musketry was continuous. The firing gradually
died away, with the exception of a little skirmishing,
which was kept up during the night, with
an occasional discharge from the batteries, to let
them know that we were on the alert. We kept
awake all night, ready to drive them back, if they
attempted to cut their way through, which it was
thought they might possibly do....
There is not much fighting this morning, although
a bullet hums by when any one goes for water or
shows his head above the level of the hill.</p>

<p>“Saturday morning, May 30.... We remained
in the ravines yesterday, the right and left wings
of the regiment having changed position. Skirmishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
was kept up all day, and the batteries
were at work a portion of the time; but the firing
was not very heavy. A smart shower passed over
toward evening, soaking us through, and we had
a prospect of passing a very disagreeable night, for
it is quite cool yet without blankets, even when
one is dry. Just at dark, however, we were relieved
by the Twelfth Maine, and sent into the
woods in rear of the batteries.”</p>

<p>This three days’ exposure to alternate heat and
moisture broke down many constitutions that had
borne up under all the severe marching through
the Tèche country; and men were daily sent to
the rear, the majority of whom died before, or
soon after, reaching Baton Rouge, to which place
the sick and wounded men were at first sent.
It would be impossible, in the limits of this sketch,
to give an extended notice of all who died from
hard service during the campaigns of the regiment;
but the writer has taken pains to prepare
a correct list, which will be found in another
place; and the facts will also be appended to each
name in its appropriate place in the company.</p>

<p>After reaching the position selected in the
woods, the blankets were brought, and, still wet
through, the regiment laid down to rest without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
equipments on, for the first time since the morning
of the assault.</p>

<p>Although the batteries kept up an occasional
fire through the night, it did not prevent sleep;
and even when a stray shell from the other side
went wandering carelessly through the forest,
making a path among the thick woods, it was
scarcely heeded, so exhausted had the men become
from the week’s labor.</p>

<p>Saturday (30th), the regiment remained in the
rear; and many were made glad by receiving letters
from home, brought by Mr. Stacy Read, of
Cambridge, who had come from Massachusetts to
make inquiries into the situation of the various
regiments from the State. At the same time,
Maj. Richardson returned to the regiment, although
not having recovered from the severe
illness with which he had been suffering.</p>

<p>The Thirty Eighth was not allowed to remain
long in the rear. As soon as the approach of
night shrouded the movement from the foe, the
line was formed in the edge of the woods; and,
cautiously marching past the batteries, taking especial
care that no loose dipper should notify the
enemy of an approach, the regiment passed unharmed
over the road where it had met with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
such a hot reception, and took its old position
in the ravines. This time, the blankets and shelter-tents
were taken; and they were arranged so
as to afford some protection from the rays of the
sun. Upon entering the woods on the morning
of the assault, the knapsacks had been left in
charge of a guard, and the men had gone into the
fight with no incumbrance but their haversacks
and canteens; and thus for three days they remained
in the ravines in front of the works, with
no shelter from the sun or rain.</p>

<p>The rations were cooked in the woods; and volunteers
went from the quarters, and carried them
to the several companies. While doing this, they
were exposed to the fire of sharpshooters from behind
the works, who had obtained a complete range
of the road travelled by the ration-bearers, and who
never failed to send their compliments, when they
saw the coffee and meat on its way to the ravines;
and in this way one member of the regiment was
killed, and one wounded.</p>

<p>Not knowing at what moment the enemy might
sally out from his works, and attempt to force his
way through the lines, and thus escape an inevitable
surrender from want of food, the troops in the
ravines were obliged to exercise strict vigilance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
especially during the night. Pickets were thrown
out on the road, and one-half of the regiment kept
awake while the other slept, all with their equipments
on, and with loaded rifles by their side, ready
for battle at the first note of alarm; but the rebels,
either doubting the practicability of a successful attack
upon the Union lines, or waiting for outside
assistance from Johnson, remained in their works,
contenting themselves with sending a few shells and
shot occasionally over the heads of the troops in the
ravines. One rebel gun, the “Lady Davis,” was
particularly active in this work, and generally sent
a few of her noisy messengers in the vicinity of the
Thirty Eighth every evening.</p>

<p>Relieved—March to Clinton—Great Heat—Deserting a Plantation—Return

Eighth.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the regiment went to the front the
second time, the men expected to be relieved
in twenty-four hours; but the fourth
day found them still there. On the evening
of that day, they were relieved, and
enjoyed another day’s rest in the woods.
What followed may be learned from the following
extract from a letter:—</p>

<p>“Saturday, June 6th, 5 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>—We are now
out of the din of battle which surrounds Port Hudson,
and went to sleep last night, for the first time
in twelve days, without the accompaniment of cannon
and musketry. It appears that the rebels
have been collecting a force at Clinton, about
twenty or thirty miles from Port Hudson, and
have recently defeated a portion of our cavalry,
compelling them to retreat; and there was danger
of our supply-trains being captured. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
consequence of this, a force has been sent out,
under command of Gen. Paine, to drive them off,
or give them battle if they stand. We started
early Friday morning; but several of the regiments
took the wrong road, and we had to wait
until they retraced their steps, and caught up with
us. At noon, we halted for an hour or so, and
then resumed our march; but, while we had
been laying in front of Port Hudson, the sun
had been climbing up in the heavens, and it
was found that we could not march as we had
done. Men began to fall, all through the line;
and the hospital stretchers were soon filled with
them, panting for breath. The whole force was
at once taken into the woods, where it remained
until six o’clock in the evening, when the march
was resumed, and kept up till nine o’clock....
We started at six this morning, and marched till
eleven, and have been in the shade since, near a
swift-running bayou, which affords an excellent
opportunity for bathing.”</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock, Saturday night, the command
was again in motion, although few had obtained
any sleep. “We nodded as we marched along,
and were completely lost if we halted a moment.”
Having marched to within eight miles of Clinton,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
the column halted, rested for a short time, and
then faced about, and took the road back, the
cavalry having gone ahead, and learned that the
enemy had evacuated the town. We again quote
from the letter:—</p>

<p>“Tuesday morning, June 9.—We are again
back in the woods opposite Port Hudson, with the
cannon booming around us; but first, I will tell
you a little more about our Clinton expedition.
Friday afternoon, while on picket, I had an opportunity
of witnessing a scene quite common in
Louisiana,—the desertion of a plantation by the
whole body of slaves. Near the picket-post was a
house, over which a guard had been placed, when
we halted the day previous, to prevent plundering.
The lady of the house, letting her temper get the
better of her judgment, abused the guard, calling
them bad names, and hoping the rebels would
get the whole of them. The officer of the guard
removed his men, and the household property began
rapidly to decrease, when the lady repented,
and the guard was restored. On the return from
Clinton, we halted near the same place; and the
house was again protected. There were about
eight negro cabins on the plantation; and the inmates
were preparing to leave the old home. All<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
their worldly possessions were spread out on the
floors of the cabins, and they were selecting a little
bundle of the most valuable; for people who
travel with the Nineteenth Army Corps have to go
in ‘light marching order.’ One man was too old
and lame to go; and he wandered around among
the busy emigrants, with a half-mournful, half-resigned
look. ‘I’m sorry we’re all gwine to leab
ye, Uncle Joe,’ said one of the men, looking up
from his work; ‘but ye couldn’t stan’ de march.’—‘No;
I can’t leab,’ said Uncle Joe, sadly, as he
hobbled off to another cabin. At the door of the
mansion, the mistress, who was so rampant yesterday,
was selling eggs at a great price to Gen.
Paine’s cooks.”</p>

<p>The march back to Port Hudson was not so
fatiguing; and the regiment again took up a position
in the woods, where it remained until the
afternoon of the 13th of June, when it was removed
to the edge of the woods, near the front,
ready to take part in the grand assault which was
announced to take place the next day. The army
had not been idle since the charge on the 27th of
May. Guns had been put in position along the
whole line, and strong works erected to protect
them; and roadways had been worked through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
the ravines, so that sharpshooters could approach
within rifle-shot, under cover. But the work of
the spade was too slow; and another assault was
resolved upon. The order of advance was announced
to the third division as follows: The
Eighth New Hampshire and the Fourth Wisconsin
to deploy as skirmishers; the Fourth Massachusetts,
and five hundred picked men, to follow
with hand-grenades; the Thirty First Massachusetts,
with bags of cotton, to fill up the ditch; and
then the three brigades of the third division, the
third brigade in the advance. This programme
was somewhat changed afterward. In regard to
a charge so interesting to the regiment, an extract
from a letter written two days after, will be allowed
to tell the story:—</p>

<p>... “We were roused a little before midnight,
and packed our blankets, which were to be
left behind. Hot coffee was served out by the
company cooks; and, with our haversacks and
canteens filled, we moved silently to the front.
Many regiments were forming on the edge of the
woods; and we expected a short, sharp fight.
Gen. Paine himself thought that we should be inside
the works within half an hour, and gave
orders that the wounded men were not to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
removed from the field till the battle was over.
Crossing a bridge, which had been covered with
cotton to deaden the sound, we marched down a
road, enclosed by thick hedges, deployed as skirmishers
on an open field, and laid down. The
centre was kept in reserve, with orders to follow
as the right and left advanced. There were two
regiments in front of us, deployed, and lying
down,—the Fourth Wisconsin and the Eighth
New Hampshire, and also a detachment of men
from other regiments, with hand-grenades, to throw
over the breastworks. Just behind us was the
Fifty Third Massachusetts. As soon as we laid
down, our artillery opened fire on the fortifications,
throwing the shot and shell over our heads;
but some of the shells fell short, injuring our own
men.</p>

<p>“After a brisk cannonading, Gen. Paine passed
down the line in front, his form just visible in the
gray of the morning, repeating to every ‘group,’
in a clear voice, ‘As soon as I have passed the line,
the Fourth Wisconsin, the Eighth New Hampshire,
and the grenadiers will go forward to the works.’
He had scarcely reached the left of the first line,
when the Wisconsin boys sprang up with a loud
cheer, and dashed through the openings in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
hedge which screened our movements from the enemy.
They were followed closely by the Eighth
and by the grenadiers. Then the general passed
down our line, saying to every company, ‘As soon
as I give the word, the Thirty Eighth and Fifty
Third will go forward.’ Soon the order came,
‘Forward Thirty Eighth and Fifty Third.’</p>

<p>“The first shout of our advance had been answered
by a volley of musketry; and the cries of
the wounded men told us what to expect. No one
hesitated, however, and the two Massachusetts regiments
pressed through the hedge. The distance to
the works was farther than we had anticipated, and
consisted of a succession of hills and ravines,
blocked up with fallen trees, scrubby bushes, and
brambles. As we passed the brow of every hill, we
were exposed to a severe fire, and our men fell
thick and fast; yet the regiment kept on, for the
voice of Gen. Paine was heard, in spite of the roar
of cannon and musketry, ‘Forward Thirty Eighth.
Forward Fifty Third.’ Many of the officers had
fallen; the nature of the ground rendered it impossible
to keep a line, and the four advance regiments
soon became completely mixed up. Still
they moved forward until ordered to stop. A few
of the Wisconsin men reached the fortifications, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
went over, where they were immediately captured;
others of them, and many of the Eighth New
Hampshire, were dead in the ditch beneath the
works. The hand-grenades had been a complete
failure, and had been thrown back by the enemy
to make sad havoc in our own ranks. More than
one third of the Thirty Eighth, and one quarter
of the Fifty Third, lay wounded and dying,
on the hills and in the ravines. The support did
not come up; and that voice which had inspired
the whole movement was no longer heard. Whatever
chance of success there may have been at the
outset, the fall of Gen. Paine destroyed it. And
now, almost without officers, the men sought cover
from the enemy’s rifles on the slopes of the hills,
and returned the fire whenever an opportunity offered.
The One Hundred and Thirty Third New
York, with its brave colonel leading, made a gallant
attempt to retrieve the disasters of the day;
but the fall of Col. Currie, and the heavy fire
poured into the regiment, caused it to seek shelter.
The Thirty First Massachusetts had advanced some
distance with the cotton-bags, with which they made
breastworks, and held a position in front of the
fortifications during the day, having over thirty
men killed and wounded.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>Major Richardson, just returned from the hospital,
and still suffering from illness, had been obliged to
leave the field, and the command devolved upon
Capt. Wyman, who, in turn, was partially disabled
by a piece of shell, which shattered his sabre, and
bruised his leg. Lieut. Holmes had been killed,
and Lieuts. Spear, Russell of Co. F, Russell of Co.
D, Bullard, and Jackson, were wounded. In all,
ninety-one of the two hundred and fifty who formed
in line that morning had been killed or wounded.
All day, the regiment, scattered in groups over the
field, remained beneath the scorching sun, suffering
for water, and exposed to the fire from their own
batteries in the rear, as well as from those of the
enemy in front.</p>

<p>Water could only be procured from a few mud-holes
in the ravines; and the paths leading to them
were commanded by the rebel works, the numerous
dead and wounded men in the vicinity telling how
dangerous was the attempt to reach them. For a
long time, Gen. Paine, who had been shot in the leg,
remained behind a log, every attempt to carry him
off the field being the signal for a volley from the
enemy, who knew that some prominent officer must
be the object of so much solicitude.</p>

<p>The stretcher corps were repeatedly fired upon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
Two colored men had succeeded in getting to the
extreme front with a stretcher, and were endeavoring
to take off a fallen soldier (supposed, at the
time, to belong to Co. I, of the Thirty Eighth),
when they were fired upon, and both fell wounded.
One of them tried to get away, and was again shot
down; and, making a second attempt, received a
third wound. But the longest day must have an
end; and darkness at length kindly came, and hid
from sight the terrible scenes of that sad Sunday.
During the evening, the few remaining officers
gathered the scattered groups together; and, about
midnight, the regiment withdrew from the field,
not, however, without a parting volley from the
rebels, who heard the movement.</p>

<p>The day after the battle, attempts were made
to recover the bodies of those who had fallen;
but, as the rebels had command of the field,
all of them could not be reached. Toward evening,
members of Co. F succeeded, after a long
search among the dead men, in finding the bodies
of Sergt. Angell and Corp. Champney, and by
torchlight laid them quietly to rest under the
magnolias near their quarters, beside another of
their comrades, Joseph A. Morris, whose body had
been recovered early in the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>It would swell our sketch to an unwieldy size to
record the names and good qualities of all those
fell on this day, or of the wounded who passed
weary months on hospital beds. Those who saw
them know how well they did their duty. In another
place, will be found a full list of the casualties.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the 15th, the long-looked for mail arrived,
with the letters that had been accumulating
at New Orleans for weeks; and
then wounds and sickness were momentarily
forgotten in the pleasure of again communing
with those at home. The letters
averaged seven or eight to each man; and some
had over a dozen; but it was sad to think how
many would be returned unopened, to strike a chill
to the hearts of the writers.</p>

<p>The wounded men were sent to Baton Rouge
and New Orleans, and the field-hospitals made
ready for a new lot of patients; for, notwithstanding
the failure of the assault, the siege still went
on.</p>

<p>But few of the Union dead had been brought
from the field; and four days they laid beneath
that summer sun before a truce was arranged, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
the bodies buried. Previous to burial, they were
placed in rows, to the number of over a hundred;
but it was impossible to recognize them, except by
some mark on their clothing, or, as was the case
with the body of Lieut. Holmes, by articles found
in the pockets.</p>

<p>The Thirty Eighth remained in the woods until
the 19th (five days), when it was again removed
to the front to support batteries, relieving the
Thirteenth Connecticut, who had excavated holes
in the side of the ravines, safe from bullets as long
as the head was kept below the crest of the hill;
but a gauntlet had to be run every time one went
for water, or to the cook-houses in the woods. In
the meantime, spades were again in the ascendant;
trenches had been dug almost up to the earthworks
of the enemy; and sharpshooters were
posted all through the ravines, so that it was
a dangerous matter for a rebel to raise his head
above the embankment. The batteries daily and
nightly threw their missiles inside of the fortress,
giving the enemy no rest; and such an accurate
range had been obtained, that rebel guns were dismounted
as soon as put in position.</p>

<p>Deserters came over occasionally, with stories of
scarcity of food, and that the only hope of Gen.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
Gardner was in outside relief; and that if Vicksburg
fell, and Grant be thus enabled to turn his
attention to Johnson, Port Hudson would fall at
once. Although his army was rapidly diminishing,
by casualties and the diseases incident to the
climate and the season, Gen. Banks still pressed
the siege vigorously, encouraging the men by his
presence and by appeals to their patriotism and
courage; and a storming party was organized and
drilled to take the lead in a new assault.</p>

<p>But stirring news was at hand, which was to
crush all the hope of the garrison in receiving
help from Johnson, and leave them in the hands
of those who had toiled so hard for the prize. On
the 7th of July, the tidings of the fall of Vicksburg
was received, and published through the camps;
and as it spread from regiment to regiment, till it
reached those almost directly beneath the works,
one shout of exultation arose, giving the enemy
an intimation of the speedy close of the struggle.
Early on the morning of the 8th, an order from
Gen. Banks was received by all the regimental
commanders, stating that Gen. Gardner had proposed
a cessation of hostilities, with a view to settling
the terms of surrender, if Gen. Banks could
satisfy him that Vicksburg had fallen. Preparations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
for the attack were still to go on, but the
general wished all active demonstrations to cease;
and, in a little while, flags of truce were put up,
and the men, who had been opposed to each other
so long, met at the breastworks, and carried on a
brisk trade, swapping hard-tack for corn-cakes, and
exchanging tin canteens for wooden ones. The
battles were discussed freely, but perfect good-humor
was maintained on both sides; and the
rebels freely passed over their corn-beer to their
late antagonists. The Fifteenth Arkansas had occupied
that part of the works opposite the post of
the Thirty Eighth, and had scarcely left the front
for thirty days; and this was the second time they
were to surrender, the whole regiment having been
captured at Donelson.</p>

<p>Gen. Gardner surrendered unconditionally, and
preparations were made to take possession at once
of the fort. Two regiments from each division
were selected to go inside, and assist at the formal
surrender of the stronghold; and, in the third
division, that honor fell upon the Eighth New
Hampshire and the Thirty Eighth Massachusetts.
This indorsement of their conduct by the commanding
general was especially gratifying to the
regiment; but they were not destined to see the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
inside of those famous works; for, on the afternoon
of the 8th, a storm came up, and the
ceremonies of the formal surrender were postponed
until the next day; and, at midnight, the
regiment was called up, and sent, with the brigade,
to Stores Plains, five miles from Port Hudson, to
relieve Dudley’s brigade, which had been ordered
to Donaldsonville, where the defeated army of
Taylor, having reassembled, were assuming the offensive.
The regiment remained at Stores Plains
until the 11th, the complete quiet which reigned
seeming almost unnatural, so long had they been
accustomed to the almost constant discharge of
cannon and musketry; and, on the afternoon of
that day, the brigade received orders to report at
Baton Rouge. All night the regiment marched,
reaching the capital as the sun arose above the
housetops; and then sought shelter from the intense
heat during the day as best it could. This
night-march, after having burrowed so long in the
holes at Port Hudson, told heavily on the men;
and many, who had been on duty during the
whole campaign, broke down, and fell out of the
ranks.</p>

<p>On the 15th, the regiment embarked on transports,
in company with the One Hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
Twenty Eighth and One Hundred and Seventy
Fifth New York, and arrived at Donaldsonville
that evening; one small boat affording sufficient
room for the three regiments. Only four or five
officers accompanied the regiment, some having
been wounded, and others having obtained furloughs
to visit New Orleans and the North; so that
the regiment made rather a ludicrous appearance
on parade, with one field, one staff, and two line
officers, four headless drums, and two hundred
ragged men. If the dress-parades did not afford
much satisfaction, the excellent bathing facilities
did; and all day the river was alive with men
who thus sought refuge from the intense heat
which prevailed.</p>

<p>On the 25th, the paymaster appeared, after a six
months’ absence; and soon the regiment formed
itself into an irregular triangle; one side being
composed by the line marching to the paymaster’s
tent, the other side by a long procession on their
way to the sutlers, and the base by the returning
crowd on their way to their quarters, with armfuls
of cheese, gingerbread, pickles, etc. The
health of the regiment was very poor at this time,
nearly every one being afflicted with a species of
scurvy sore, the consequence of an almost entire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
abstinence from vegetables for so long a time;
and, for some days after the arrival of the paymaster,
the army rations were hardly touched.
This state of things was, of course, very gratifying
to the sutlers, and to the numerous corn-beer
and gingerbread venders, whose stands
sprung up like mushrooms, all over the town,
as soon as the troops were paid.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AUGUST 1, the regiment embarked for Baton
Rouge, landed, and went into camp near
the Highland Road, just outside of the
city, when clothing was issued, and the
men once more had an opportunity to appear
decently. From this time until the
following February, the history of the regiment
presents no striking features; but it was far from
being idle.</p>

<p>On the 2d of September, a large portion of the
troops at Baton Rouge embarked for what was
then supposed to be a Texan expedition; and the
Thirty Eighth was ordered out to guard the
streets leading from the levee, and prevent any of
the men from leaving their command,—an unpleasant
duty at all times. A few days after, the
regiment changed camp, moving near the city,
on the ground recently occupied by the Forty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
Ninth Massachusetts, and calling their new location
“Camp William L. Rodman.” This camp
was just outside the line of works surrounding
Baton Rouge; and, upon a threatened attack one
night from the bands of guerillas who hovered
around the lines continually, the camp was abandoned,
with the tents standing, while the regiment
bivouacked on the boulevards in the city until
morning; when, there being no prospect of an engagement,
it once more returned to its quarters.</p>

<p>The Thirty First Massachusetts having been sent
to New Orleans for the purpose of being mounted,
the Thirty Eighth removed into the vacant camp
(Camp Banks) on the 10th of December. Cos. A
and K were detailed as provost guard, and had
quarters in the city, where they were efficient in
preserving order, and gave satisfaction alike to the
commander of the post and to the inhabitants of
the city, who were protected in all legitimate business,
and who ever found the men of these two
companies courteous and polite when on duty, and
quiet and peaceable at all times. Co. I was stationed
at Plaquemine, a portion of the company
being mounted; and, in conjunction with the
Fourth Wisconsin Cavalry, they did efficient service
in guarding that town against the incursions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
of the guerillas, who harassed the few people disposed
to render allegiance to the government, and
took every opportunity to capture wagon-trains,
and shoot those who ventured outside of the lines.
The remaining companies picketed a portion of the
line, did guard-duty in the commissary and other
departments, and furnished men to act as clerks
and orderlies, and do other duties incident to the
garrisoning of such an important post; while a
number of the officers held important positions on
the staffs of the post and brigade commanders.</p>

<p>No articles whatever were allowed to be taken
outside of the lines without a permit; and the
pickets were instructed to use great care in examining
all parties; but it became a delicate task
occasionally, when some fair-looking dame, taking
advantage of the respect ever shown to woman by
the members of the regiment, attempted to “run
the blockade.” On more than one occasion,
where the suspicions were unusually strong, a
gentle shaking brought strange appendages to
the ground, to the confusion of the owner, and
the amusement of the boys; and a close examination
of the seats and bottoms of vehicles often
brought to light articles not on the permits.</p>

<p>As the year drew to a close, the weather became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
cold; and, during Christmas-week, the pickets
often found the water in their canteens frozen
in the morning, and their beards white with the
frost. The citizens complained of the cold also,
saying that such weather had not been seen in
Baton Rouge for twenty years, and that the
Yankees had brought their climate down with
them; which may have been true, for they had
established some customs quite as uncongenial to
the South as the cold weather. It was reported
that one chivalrous citizen, after taking the oath,
with the intention of supporting the government,
became so disgusted at seeing a sign hung out,
stating that doughnuts and baked beans were to
be had within, that he immediately left for some
country where New England and her famous
dishes were unheard off.</p>

<p>The health of the regiment was remarkably
good through the winter, some companies reporting
every man for duty, notwithstanding the fact
that they were on picket twice a week, exposed to
all the storms of the season; but the quarters in
the camp were comfortable, consisting of board
shanties, three to four feet high at the sides, with
tent-roofs, and furnished with stoves, bunks, and
stools. By this time, the men began to consider<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
themselves veterans, making it a point to look out
for personal conveniences; and, as a consequence,
“household stuff” accumulated, so that whenever
the regiment broke camp, they left a variety of
articles, valuable in the eyes of the contrabands.</p>

<p>On New Year’s, a ball took place under the
direction of Co. A, then doing provost duty in
the city; but the sympathies of the people were
still with the bands of guerillas prowling about
outside of the lines, and they held themselves
aloof from Union officers and men; so that the
ball was not graced by the presence of many
ladies. During the winter, J. C. Wellington,
Esq., of Cambridge, who had been commissioned
by the governor of Massachusetts to visit all the
regiments from that State then in the Department
of the Gulf, spent a number of days in the camp,
conforming to army life, and making himself familiar
with the condition of the regiment.</p>

<p>During the first week in January, the alarms
occasioned by guerillas were unusually frequent;
and the regiment was under arms several times,
the pickets doubled, and preparations made to repel
an assault; but the enemy never came within
musket-shot of the breastworks, although they
captured detached parties. For several weeks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
the brigade stood under arms from daylight until
after sunrise; while the pickets deployed in a
skirmish-line; but the guerillas never fulfilled
their threat of dining in Baton Rouge.</p>

<p>Wednesday, Feb. 27, the Fourth Wisconsin Cavalry
raised a new flag in their camp, celebrating
the event with music and speeches, and the Thirty
Eighth were invited to be present, with other regiments.
They appeared with full ranks, to the evident
gratification of the Fourth; and from this
time, the good feeling between the two regiments,
which had been partially interrupted by an unfortunate
affair between a member of the Fourth and
one of the provost guards, resulting in the death
of the former, was restored. On the 3d of February,
the One Hundred and Twenty Eighth New
York raised a new flag, with appropriate ceremonies,
reminding the spectators of the early times
of the war, when patriotism expressed itself in
bunting.</p>

<p>The rebels still hovered around the picket-line;
and on the 8th of February, Lieut. Williams, one
of the most daring of the Wisconsin officers, was
killed just outside of the lines, several of his men
being wounded at the same time, and the detachment
which accompanied him driven back. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
regiment immediately started in pursuit, and
captured several of the enemy; while the third
brigade were under arms behind the breastworks.</p>

<p>Feb. 7, the Thirty Eighth and the One Hundred
and Fifty Sixth marched to the stockade,
seven or eight miles from the city; and, on the
march back, a scrub-race took place between the
two regiments,—molasses <em>versus</em> sour-krout, as
the boys called it,—molasses coming in slightly
ahead.</p>

<p>March 11, a number of recruits joined the regiment,
for the first time in its history; the Department
of the Gulf evidently not being in favor
among the latter volunteers.</p>

<p>It should have been mentioned before, that the
ladies of Cambridge, during the summer, had procured
a very handsome silk flag, with the name
of the regiment, and the engagements in which it
had taken part, inscribed upon it in golden letters.
This flag was forwarded to Baton Rouge, and entrusted
to the care of the regiment by Major Allen,
who read a very eloquent and patriotic letter from
the donors, and also read the reply which was to
be sent in the name of the regiment. Five more
battles were afterward placed upon its stripes.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE campaign had already opened on the
Red River, with the capture of Fort de
Russy by Gen. A. J. Smith; and a batch
of three hundred prisoners had been sent
to Baton Rouge, and thence to New Orleans.
The Seventh and Twenty Second
Kentucky Regiments had arrived to garrison the
post; and the third brigade daily expected orders
to prepare for the field.</p>

<p>On the 21st of March, the ever-welcome face of
the paymaster was seen in camp, the regiment
receiving two months’ pay; and the next day, the
surplus baggage was packed, the campaign coffee
and sugar bags made, the detailed men returned
to their several companies, the cartridge-boxes
filled, and everything made ready to start at a
moment’s notice. The regiment had become well
accustomed to river-steamers by this time; and, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
the regimental baggage had been cut down from
its former huge proportions, breaking camp was
now a comparatively easy task, consequently, there
was but little delay after reaching the levee; and
at noon of the 23d, the transport left Baton Rouge,
and steamed up the river. Much interest was
manifested to see Port Hudson from the river-side;
and that place, so famous in the annals of
the Thirty Eighth, was reached in time to see the
setting sun cast its rays on the glistening musket
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Corps d’Afrique</span> sentinel, who walked his
beat on its ramparts. The regiment had now been
in front of Port Hudson, and to the rear of it, and
on all sides of it, but were never destined to enter
its works.</p>

<p>Leaving the Mississippi, the steamer entered the
Red River, and, on the afternoon of the 24th,
passed Fort de Russy, a grim-looking structure,
but now in the hands of its rightful owners; while
those two old Mississippi mud-turtles, the Benton
and the Essex, lay silently at anchor, pictures of
war in repose. The country of the Red River
presents a striking contrast to that of the Mississippi.
For miles, the traveller sails on, through an
almost unbroken forest, the river taking a new
turn every few yards. Occasionally a clearing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
comes in sight, in the centre of which stands a
dilapidated building, apparently engaged in a perpetual
conflict with the laws of gravitation; a few
cattle and long-nosed hogs, and a great many lank
dogs, roam about the apology for a garden; while
groups of flaxen-headed children peer out of the
doorways. It is the country of the poor whites,
where labor is considered degrading, where education
is unknown, and where Northern enterprise
has never penetrated. But the North-western
farmer boys have looked on this rich soil; the
North-western and the North-eastern lumbermen
have felled the tall trees near the river-bank; the
mechanics of Massachusetts and New York have
seen the field for improved implements in husbandry
and in domestic life; and ere many years
this distant Southern country will put on a new
life, and be the seat of an educated, industrious
people.</p>

<p>The boat reached Alexandria at midnight, and,
the next morning the regiment disembarked, and
went into camp three miles beyond the city. The
place was full of troops, belonging to the Thirteenth
Corps, who had been in Texas, and had marched
up through the Tèche country; the Sixteenth and
Seventeenth Corps, who had captured De Russy;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
the Nineteenth Corps, a portion of whom had been
in the department so long that they had become
fully acclimated; and one or two brigades of colored
troops—mostly Louisianians. The third
brigade of the second division was selected to garrison
Alexandria, while the main body of the army
moved up the country toward Shreveport; and
the Thirty Eighth removed to one of the vacated
camps, falling heir to the stock of boards collected
by the Western men, who were adepts in <ins class="corr" id="tn-129" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'building shantees'">
building shanties</ins>.</p>

<p>April 1, the regiment again broke camp, moving
nearer the centre of the city; and as Gen. Grover,
of the second division, had command of the post
at Alexandria, and the army having met with but
slight opposition in its march toward Shreveport,
it was thought that the third brigade would go no
further. At Alexandria, in addition to picket, the
regiment did much fatigue duty,—lugging oats,
corn, hard-tack, etc., up the steep banks of the
levee, working nights as well as days. Beside the
white and black soldiers, there was an appendix to
the army at Alexandria, consisting of a body of
gray-coated scouts, natives of this portion of the
country, acquainted with all the by-ways and the
hiding-places of the rebels, who went out and in at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
their pleasure, and who were looked upon rather
uneasily at times by the troops, although confidence
was placed in them by Gen. Banks.</p>

<p>For some days, the reports from the moving
army and navy were all favorable; the rebels were
in full retreat, abandoning their strongholds, and
falling back upon Shreveport, where they were to
find Gen. Steele in their rear, and the whole trans-Mississippi
country was to fall into the hands of the
Union generals. Suddenly, there was a pause in
the news; then ominous whispers of disaster;
finally a full confirmation of the ill-tidings,—Nims’s,
the Chicago, and a regular battery taken;
the newly-mounted infantry regiments defeated
and demoralized; the Thirteenth corps cut to
pieces, and heavy losses in the Nineteenth; with
the entire army on the defensive. All thoughts
of summer quarters in Alexandria were at an
end; and on the 12th, the regiment struck tents,
marched a few miles beyond the town, and embarked
on board the Mittie Stephens, to join the
army above. The boat steamed on until midnight,
when the low state of the water, and the frequent
turns in the river, rendered it imprudent to go further;
and a halt was made beside the bank, a
picket being thrown out to guard against guerillas.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
Starting at daylight in the morning, the boat proceeded
on her course, without incident until noon,
making rather slow progress against the current.
As usual, when on a transport, the men were scattered
about the vessel, making coffee, eating, sleeping,
and reading, not a gun loaded, the equipments
and knapsacks piled up promiscuously, and the
officers all in the cabin. Every one felt as secure
as if sailing up Boston Harbor, when suddenly a
gunshot was heard; and before a minute had
elapsed, a shower of bullets poured into the boat,
rattling against the smoke-pipe, smashing the
cabin-windows, and whistling by the heads of the
astonished men. Taken completely by surprise,
away from their guns and equipments, and no
enemy in sight, for a few moments there was some
confusion; but the men soon rallied, and poured
several volleys into the woods, although, as the
boat kept on her course, the fire was probably
ineffectual.</p>

<p>Considering that the regiment was fully exposed,
and the enemy perfectly secure in his hiding-place,
the casualties were remarkably few. One man,
sick in the cabin, and lying on a sofa, was instantly
killed, and one officer and two men wounded.
Another attack was expected at the next bend of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
the river, and preparations were made to meet it;
but nothing further occurred, and, within an hour
or two, the Union pickets were seen on the bank
of the river, and the steamer soon reached Grand
Ecore, where the Nineteenth Army Corps was
encamped. A boat crowded with captured gray-coats
lay in the stream; and as the Mittie Stephens
passed her, the Union men, feeling in bad
humor over the guerilla attack, exulted a little;
but the rebels shouted back the taunts defiantly,
and pointed up the river.</p>

<p>The brigade being still at Alexandria, the Thirty
Eighth was temporarily assigned to the second
brigade of the third division, commanded by Brig.
Gen. Birge; and during the two or three days succeeding,
the camp was twice changed again, before
a proper position was found.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE greater portion of Gen. Banks’s army
was then at Grand Ecore, and busily at
work throwing up breastworks,—the pine
forests furnishing abundant logs for the
purpose,—while the river was crowded
with gun-boats and transports. Of course
the recent battles were the general topics discussed,
and there appeared to be as many opinions
regarding the details as there were soldiers present.
The Western officers and men laid the blame of
the repulse on the Eastern generals; the infantry
charged it on the cavalry, the artillery on the infantry
support; the navy on the army. But there
were a few general facts on which all the stories
agreed, and which may be stated in the following
order: 1st. The rebels having steadily fallen back
before the advance of the Union army, neither officers
nor men expected a serious opposition until
the works at Shreveport were reached, by which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
time it was supposed that Gen. Steele would be
ready to coöperate; consequently, the advance was
taken by surprise when they found the entire force
of the enemy stopping their path. 2d. A portion
of the cavalry had been but recently mounted;
and men who were excellent infantry soldiers when
armed with infantry weapons, being obliged to dismount
in the woods, found their cavalry equipments
a great hindrance. 3d. This imperfect
cavalry, with a few light batteries, and a small
infantry support, was separated by four or five
hours’ march from the Nineteenth Corps, with the
cavalry baggage-train well up to the front, and
blocking up the road between. 4th. The Sixteenth
and Seventeenth Corps were not within
supporting distance of the other portion of the
army. These statements were made by scores of
men at the time, and are substantially embodied in
the Adjutant General’s reports of the various
Massachusetts’ regiments engaged in the expedition.
Although the fall of the water in the Red
River made it necessary to retreat from Grand
Ecore, the repulse at Sabine Cross Roads was
a purely military disaster,—the result of a disposition
of the forces which invited attack. Others
may apportion the blame, and say who was responsible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
for the lives of the men sacrificed in this disastrous
campaign; the failure did not result from
lack of courage in either the Eastern or Western
portions of the army. During the second Red
River expedition, the Army of the Gulf did not
have that confidence in some of its commanders
so essential to success. The troops thought it bad
enough to get the condemned hard-tack of the
Army of the Potomac, without having its condemned
generals; and Emory and Weitzel and
Paine and Grover, under Gen. Banks, were considered
competent to lead them to victory as they
had done the year before.</p>

<p>As some relief to the disasters, all concurred in
awarding great honor to Nims’s Battery, which, with
double-shotted guns, mowed down the ranks of
the advancing rebels while their ammunition lasted,
and only attempted to save themselves when their
horses were shot and there was no possibility of
getting their pieces off the field. The Nineteenth
Corps, also, acted as became it, and taught the
enemy, that although repulsed, the Army of the
Gulf was not demoralized; while the Sixteenth
and Seventeenth Corps sustained the reputation
they had acquired under Gen. Grant.</p>

<p>Extensive breastworks were erected at Grand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
Ecore, each regiment building opposite its own
line; so that the whole camp was soon enclosed, in
anticipation of an attack.</p>

<p>Thursday, April 16, a detail of one hundred
men being called for from the regiment, Cos. C,
G, and H, were selected, and sent to guard a transport
on her passage down the river; and the next
day the regiment again changed camp. But the
water was rapidly falling; it began to be whispered
that a large force was collecting on the river below,
to cut off all supplies; and the news of the defeat
of Gen. Steele was confirmed. On the 21st,
marching orders were received; and the entire
army prepared to evacuate Grand Ecore, and
retreat to Alexandria. As a rapid march was expected,
with the probability of having to fight all
the way down, everything superfluous was destroyed,
and blankets, overcoats, extra clothing,
and relics went to feed the flames which were
rising in every direction through the pine woods.
Not a hard-tack box was left for the enemy; and
their only spoils of war consisted in the well constructed
line of breastworks surrounding the encampment.</p>

<p>The sick men were put on board of transports;
and at five o’clock in the afternoon, the retreat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
began, the Nineteenth Corps in advance. Working
its way slowly through the immense wagon-train,
the third brigade took the road through the
pine woods, in which large fires had been built to
guide the men in picking their way among the
stumps. The Thirteenth Corps followed the Nineteenth;
and the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Corps,
under the command of Gen. A. J. Smith, brought
up the rear. The advance marched till four
o’clock in the morning, through woods and
plains, and then went into camp, having made
over twenty-five miles; while far in the rear, the
lurid light of burning barns and mills told where
the Western soldiers, thinking of the tortures of
their fifty thousand comrades in the prisons of
Virginia and Carolina, were making war with
ungloved hands.</p>

<p>The march was continued the next day; and,
in the twenty-four hours after leaving Grand
Ecore, forty miles had been travelled. But the
enemy, who had been exulting over the anticipated
capture of Gen. Banks and his entire army,
were not disposed to let the prize slip through
their fingers so easily; and on the morning of
the 23d of April, as the Nineteenth Corps were
marching along the banks of Cane River, near the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
crossing, the rebels opened with artillery on the
advance. The infantry at once formed in line of
battle, in the road and the adjoining fields, while
the light batteries were sent to the front, followed
by Gen. Banks and staff. After a brisk cannonading
with little apparent result, a body of troops,
under command of Gen. Birge, was sent across
the river,—the detachment of the third brigade,
led by Col. Smith, of the One Hundred and
Twenty Eighth New York, being the first to ford
the stream. Climbing up the steep banks, the
brigade entered the woods, and, marching through
a swamp, came in the rear of the enemy, when
the Thirty Eighth was sent forward in advance
to skirmish, and ascertain the position of the
rebels. Moving steadily forward through woods
and across open fields, occasionally receiving a
shot from a concealed enemy, the regiment passed
a narrow stream, skirmished up a thickly wooded
hill, and down its descending slope, till a rail-fence
was reached, bounding a cleared piece of ground,
beyond which was another wooded bluff, showing
signs of rebel occupancy. A halt was made behind
this fence, while the reserve formed in the
rear, and dismounted cavalry was sent into the
woods on the right to reconnoitre. The order<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
“Forward” soon came; and the Thirty Eighth,
still deployed, went over the fence, and charged
the hill under a heavy fire. Thanks to Gen.
Birge, the regiment was not thrown forward unsupported.
Emerging from the woods, the Thirtieth
Maine and the One Hundred and Sixty Second
and the One Hundred and Sixty Fifth New
York followed the skirmishers, in a magnificent
line of battle, charging across the open field and
up the bluff, from which, after a short resistance,
the rebels retreated precipitately, leaving a portion
of their dead and wounded on the ground.</p>

<p>Reforming the lines, and being strongly reinforced,
the column advanced through the woods
to another opening, with a hill beyond similar to
the one just taken, and where it was expected the
enemy would make a more stubborn resistance;
but when the charge was made in lines of battle,
with fixed bayonets, no foe was found, and the
road to the river was clear.</p>

<p>That night the regiment encamped near the spot
where it had crossed in the morning; and glad
enough were the men to unsling the knapsacks
which they had carried all day, and gather around
the camp-fires, to discuss the battle, while they prepared
their simple supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>The casualties had been comparatively few, the
close ranks of the support furnishing a fairer
target than the skirmish-line. Capt. Julius M.
Lathrop, of Co. I, was mortally wounded, and
died a few days afterward. Capt. Lathrop had
rode in an ambulance the day previous, unable to
march; but, upon the approach of an engagement,
had taken command of his company, and was leading
his men when he received the fatal shot. The
regiment lost two killed and eight wounded, the
greater part of the wounded men dying during the
summer.</p>

<p>As soon as the enemy was driven off, a pontoon
bridge was thrown across the river, and the wagon-trains
and the batteries passed over. The Nineteenth
Corps had continued the march during the
night, followed by the Thirteenth Corps; and the
next morning the One Hundred and Twenty
Eighth marched on, leaving the Thirty Eighth
with the Western corps, who had been engaged
with the enemy in the morning, and who reached
the crossing as the rear of the other corps left it.</p>

<p>An immense number of contrabands, of all ages,
sizes, and colors, came in with Gen. Smith, laden
down with bundles, hastily packed up as they
deserted the plantation, and left old massa and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
missus to hoe their own corn and bake their own
hoecakes. Some were mounted on mules, and
some had rigged up old mule-carts, and filled
them with bags of clothes, iron pots, and babies.
An artist would have found many subjects worthy
of his pencil in the quaint procession; and one
group impressed itself very vividly upon the mind
of the present writer. A woman, with an immense
bundle on her head, was leading a mule
by a rope-halter, walking with as stately a tread
as did ever Cleopatra. Astride of the mule were
two little children, the foremost one holding on to
a large bundle, the other clasping her companion’s
waist. The children were neatly dressed, the long
fringe on their straw hats partially shading their
faces, while their eyes were steadily fixed on their
mother; and the complexion of the whole party
told of other than African blood.</p>

<p>The appearance of these contrabands reminded
the spectator of the exodus of the Israelites from
Egypt; for, like the ancient fugitives from slavery,
these modern ones had evidently borrowed largely
from their masters and mistresses, and many a
gay parasol and lace mantle spoke of the mansion
rather than the cabin. They were illy prepared,
however, with such loads, to accompany a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
retreating army, closely pursued by its foes; and,
either by the advice or command of some wise
officer, a sifting of their effects took place at the
crossing, and a portion of their burdens was left
behind. The Western boys rigged themselves in
the cast-off bonnets and gowns, and the Sixteenth
and Seventeenth Corps looked like a masquerading
party as they filed across the pontoon.</p>

<p>For some unexplained reason, the Thirty Eighth
was detained to support a battery, until the whole
army had crossed the river, and the pontoon was
taken up, when the battery moved on, and the
regiment followed. Everything now in the rear
was rebel; and the unfortunate soldier who fell
out had a fair chance of seeing Galveston via
Shreveport. The enemy followed, and had constant
skirmishes with the cavalry; but the infantry
was not again engaged; and, after three days hard
marching, partly through the pine woods, the regiment
entered Alexandria on the afternoon of the
26th, and went into camp near the place from
which it had started fourteen days previously,
finding a large mail awaiting it, much to its
gratification.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ALTHOUGH the army had thus reached
Alexandria in safety, the fleet was still
above the rapids, and there appeared to
be no prospect of the river rising. The
enemy were busily at work on the lower
part of the river, throwing up earthworks;
and in a short time all communication was cut off,
and several transports captured, one of which contained
a large mail sent from Alexandria upon the
arrival of the army at that place.</p>

<p>But there were men in the Nineteenth Corps to
whom obstacles only brought increased energy;
and the bold project of damming the Red River,
and thereby raising the water to a sufficient height
to float the iron-clads over the rapids, was undertaken
by Lieut.-Col. Bailey of the Fourth Wisconsin
Cavalry. Gen. Banks provided a great number
of negroes for this purpose; and assistance was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
rendered by details from the several divisions of
the army, which, in the meanwhile, was engaged in
throwing up an additional line of breastworks
around Alexandria.</p>

<p>The fatigue duty was very hard at this time;
for, in addition to the work of intrenching, the
infantry had to unload the greater portion of the
transports, not only of the rations for its own use,
but also of the oats and corn for the cavalry, working
night as well as day, carrying heavy burdens
up the steep banks of the levee, which were made
slippery by the frequent rains. While the infantry
was thus at work, the cavalry was no less actively
engaged in reconnoissances; and scarcely
a day passed in which wounded men were not
brought into the town.</p>

<p>On the 7th of May, the Thirty Eighth and the
One Hundred and Twenty Eighth New York, accompanied
by a squadron of cavalry, marched thirteen
or fourteen miles from Alexandria, as guard
to a wagon-train, which had been sent to procure
forage. Scouts reported a body of the enemy engaged
in obstructing the road, and there had been
some skirmishing by the cavalry in the morning;
so that the order, “Over the levee!” caused no
surprise. Like a wave rolling up a smooth beach,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
the regiment swept over the embankment in an unbroken
line, and then paused to see what the matter
was; but no explanation could be given, and
the march was resumed. This incident illustrated
the complete discipline existing in the regiment,
and the promptitude with which orders were
obeyed. In the afternoon, the detachment returned
to camp, having marched nearly thirty
miles since morning.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Col. Bailey had succeeded in his difficult
undertaking; and, on the 9th, the gun-boats floated
over the rapids, and arrived at Alexandria.
Preparations were at once made to evacuate the
town, and march to the Mississippi; and the men
worked night and day, loading the transports with
quartermaster’s stores and ammunition. At two
o’clock, on the morning of the 11th, the regiment
broke camp; and, with the brigade, began the
march; but the progress of evacuation was slow,
and it was not until the 14th that the whole army
was fairly on the road. That day, the point was
passed where the enemy had blockaded the river;
and near their rifle-pits were found the remnants
of the captured mails, the ground being covered
with the envelopes of the sixteen thousand letters
that had fallen into their hands. The postage-stamps,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
not yet defaced, had been carefully torn
off, as if the captors had a lurking suspicion that
the portrait of Washington was of more intrinsic
value than that of either of the Confederate chiefs.</p>

<p>Although the enemy had abandoned their position
on the river, they still continued to harass
the retreating army, keeping the cavalry constantly
skirmishing; and on the afternoon of the 15th, the
firing became so rapid, that the army formed in
line of battle several times, with the expectation
of an engagement. At sundown, the musketry increased,
accompanied by artillery, and the second
division of the Nineteenth Corps went through the
little town of Marksville on the double-quick, to
the assistance of the cavalry, who were reported to
have been severely handled. The enemy drew off,
however, and the division bivouacked on an open
plain beyond the village. Gen. Grover performed
an act of kindness that night for the regiment,
which was never forgotten. No water could be
found nearer than the village, at least half a mile
distant; and while the men were debating whether
to hunt for wells in the dark, or to lie down
parched with thirst, the cavalry body-guard of
Gen. Grover rode into the camp, with instructions
from the general to take all the canteens of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
Thirty Eighth, fill them, and bring them back;
which they proceeded to do.</p>

<p>The morning was ushered in by discharges of
artillery at the front; and the division moved forward
in line of battle across the Plains of Mansura.
In the absence of Col. Sharpe, the command
of the third brigade devolved upon Col.
Smith of the One Hundred and Twenty Eighth
New York; but that brave officer being disabled,
Lieut.-Col. Richardson, at the approach of an engagement,
left the ambulance in which he had
been obliged to perform the greater part of the
march, put himself at the head of the brigade, and
manœuvred it over the field of battle as coolly,
and with as much skill, as when on the parade-ground
at Camp Kearney, leaving the Thirty
Eighth under the command of Capt. Wyman,
who was never known to flinch in battle.</p>

<p>The advance of the Nineteenth Army Corps
across the Plains of Mansura on the 16th of May,
was the finest military spectacle seen in the Department
of the Gulf during the war. The batteries
at the front, enveloped in smoke; the infantry
moving steadily up in lines of battle,
division, brigade, and regimental flags easily distinguished;
the cavalry on the flanks, impatiently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
waiting an opportunity to charge; with the long
lines of ambulances and wagons in the rear,—all
of which could be taken in at a glance,—stamped
itself on the memory of those present with a vividness
never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>As the lines moved forward, the enemy fell back,
his fire gradually slackening, until it finally ceased,
and he retreated by one of the roads branching
off into the interior. The infantry had not come
within musket-shot during this engagement; and
although the shot and shell from the rebel batteries
fell all over the field,—one huge mass of iron
falling a few feet in front of Co. H,—there were no
casualties in the regiment. But the whole corps
suffered severely from the want of water, being
obliged to quench their thirst in mud-holes from
which the hogs had to be driven, and which was
more than lukewarm.</p>

<p>Continuing the march, in the afternoon a belt
of woods was reached, with a clear bayou running
through it, at the sight of which one glad cry broke
from the ranks, and the brigade rushed eagerly to
its banks. A halt was made beside this stream,
until the men had fully quenched their thirst, and
rested; then emerging from the woods, the old
Semmesport Road came in sight, over which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
army had marched the year before; and, as the
regiment passed by the familiar sugar-houses and
plantations, sad memories rushed to the mind, of
comrades who had then shared the toils and pleasures
of the march, now done forever with life’s
battles.</p>

<p>The army went into camp a mile beyond the
resting-place of the previous year; and the next
morning, after a march of eight miles reached the
Atchafalaya, where a large number of transports
and gun-boats were collected. Although the enemy
had withdrawn from the front, he still hung in the
rear; and on the 18th, an engagement took place,
when the enemy were driven back by Gen. Mower,
in command of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth
Corps, assisted by the cavalry division. The Third
and Sixth Massachusetts Cavalry made several
brilliant charges in the action, did effective service,
and lost a number of men.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the 18th, the Nineteenth Corps crossed
the Atchafalaya, near which it remained,
merely changing camp several times, until
the 20th; and on the evening of that day,
the entire naval and military force left
Semmesport for the Mississippi. The Sixteenth
and Seventeenth Corps were on the transports,
on their return to the department from
which they had been borrowed; while the Thirteenth
and Nineteenth Corps, with the cavalry, were
to continue the march through the country.</p>

<p>At the junction of the Atchafalaya and the Red
Rivers the main army and the navy separated.
The sun was setting as the long procession of
river-boats, gun-boats, and monitors swept around
the bend of the river; and a feeling of loneliness
fell on the army as it turned inland, and took
the course for the Mississippi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>The previous year, the country was everywhere
flooded, and the water-mark could now be seen on
the houses and trees; but the summer of 1864 was
a dry one, and the roads in good condition to
march. At midnight, the army went into camp;
and the day following reached the banks of the
Mississippi, at Morganza Bend, after one of the
most fatiguing marches the regiment had ever experienced.
After a great deal of manœuvring on
the evening of the 21st and the forenoon of the
following day, the division finally encamped on the
sandy plain between the new levee and the river,
where it quietly remained, recovering from the
fatigue of the march, until the morning of the
30th, when the third brigade of the second division,
and a portion of the Thirteenth corps, with
cavalry and artillery, left the camp and took the
road to the Atchafalaya.</p>

<p>The column marched until 10 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, halted during
the heat of the day, and started again at 8 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>
As night came on, the road became poor, and
marching difficult; but no danger was evidently
anticipated by the commanding officer, for the
usual precaution, when in an enemy’s country, of
throwing out flankers, was dispensed with. Suddenly,
from a thickly wooded hill on the left, across<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
a bayou, a volley of musketry broke upon the stillness
of the night, taking effect in the Twenty Second
Iowa, in advance of the Thirty Eighth. “Ambushed!”
was the thought of all, as the ranks
closed up, and formed in line of battle in good
order. A battery sent a shell into the woods from
whence the discharge had come; but there was no
response; and, after remaining in line for a short
time, the column moved forward, but had scarcely
started when another volley came from the woods,
this time directed against the regiments in the rear.
The echoes had not died away, when a sheet of
flame flashed along the line of the One Hundred
and Fifty Sixth and One Hundred and Seventy
Fifth, followed by a crashing report.</p>

<p>Nothing more was heard from the enemy; and
as soon as a bridge was reached, the Thirty Eighth
was sent across the bayou, to act as “flankers.”
The darkness could almost be felt; and as the men
groped their way through the woods, falling into
holes, tumbling over stumps, and occasionally
running into a thorn-tree, with a lurking suspicion
all the time, which was afterward confirmed, that
the main army did not know of their presence
across the stream, and that the accidental discharge
of a rifle would be the signal for a murderous volley<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
from their friends, it will not be wondered at
that respect for those in command was, for the time
being, lost, and that officers and men alike were
disgusted at the incompetency shown. It is needless
to say that Gen. Emory was not with the expedition.</p>

<p>After a mile or two of this stumbling work, the
column halted, it being then midnight, and “bivouacked
in rear of the stacks.” One officer in the
Twenty Second Iowa had been killed, and several
men in the One Hundred and Fifty Sixth and
One Hundred and Seventy Fifth New York,
wounded, by the fire of the guerillas; and it was
reported that a number of the enemy had been
killed by the heavy volley of the two latter regiments.
Several parties living near the spot were
arrested, but their fate was never made known.</p>

<p>In the morning, the command retraced its steps,
and marched back, to the resting-place of the day
previous, where it remained during the night, getting
the benefit of a summer rain. The next day,
June 1, the expedition again marched toward the
Atchafalaya, and remained in reserve a short distance
from that river while the Seventh Massachusetts
Battery shelled a saw-mill on the opposite side,
destroying its machinery, and rendering it useless.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
Another night was spent in the vicinity, and on the
morning of the 2d the command marched back to
camp, glad that the “saw-mill expedition” was
over.</p>

<p>Nothing further transpired until the 6th of the
month, when the paymaster arrived, and the division
received four months’ pay, to its own satisfaction
and to the great profit of the sutlers, who
gathered as turkey-buzzards to a feast. With the
exception of several reviews, for the gratification
of travelling generals, the regiment remained in
camp, sending out a picket every day, and drilling
in the morning, until June 19, when it embarked
on the steamer Starlight, and proceeded up the
river as far as Fort Adams, in the State of Mississippi,
the guerillas having made their appearance
in that vicinity. This excursion was a pleasant
one, the regiment bivouacking under the trees on
the bank of the river during the day, and retiring
on board the transport when the mosquitoes became
troublesome at night. No enemy being discovered,
the troops returned to Morganza on the
21st, and occupied their old camps.</p>

<p>From this time until the 1st of July, about all
the volunteer labor performed by the men consisted
in writing the two words “very hot” in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
diaries, although there was some involuntary work,
such as corps reviews, inspections, etc., with the
thermometer up to 100° in the shade, and the
sand blistering to the feet; while the picket had a
nightly contest with the mosquitoes,—Louisiana
mosquitoes, be it remembered. On the 1st of July,
the Sixth Massachusetts Cavalry (formerly the
Thirty First Infantry) passed by Morganza in a
transport, on their way home on furlough, having
re-enlisted; and the Thirty Eighth formed in line
on the river-bank, and gave them a farewell cheer.</p>

<p>The camp as usual was full of rumors with
regard to future movements; and one day the
brigade would be going to Texas; then to New
Orleans to do provost duty; then they were to be
transformed into marines, and patrol the river on
steamboats; again, Col. Ingraham had procured a
“soft thing for the regiment in Washington.” On
the 3d of June, however, the brigade, now increased
by the addition of the One Hundred and
Seventy Sixth New York, embarked on board of
the City of Memphis, and the next day (July
4), landed at Algiers, and went into camp, where
it remained until the 20th. On the march to Morganza,
for some frivolous pretext, the brigade commander,
who was disliked by the entire brigade,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
had put the lieutenant-colonel of the Thirty Eighth
under arrest. The charges were investigated by a
court-martial, and Lieut.-Col. Richardson was honorably
acquitted and restored to his command.
The entire absence, in this officer, of that pomp
assumed by many of the Eastern officers, and which
was seldom found in the Western regiments, together
with his desire to make the duties of the
rank and file as agreeable as was compatible with
good discipline, and his superior military acquirements,
had won the attachment of the regiment;
and, upon his being restored to the command, the
men procured a band, and serenaded him in his
quarters, to which he replied in a neat speech.</p>

<p>The regiment remained at Algiers, trying to
keep cool during the day, and fighting mosquitoes
at night, until the 20th of July, when it
took passage on the Karnack, with two companies
of the Thirteenth Connecticut, and squads
belonging to other regiments, and, bidding good-by
to the Mississippi, was once more on the blue
water. Fortunate was it for the Thirty Eighth
that no storms disturbed the Atlantic during this
passage, or their history would have had a sudden
termination; for the vessel on which they embarked
was old, and had been on the Florida reefs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
the previous voyage; the crew scarcely knew one
rope from another, and their officers knew very
little more; the troops were packed so close, above
deck and below, that there was barely room to turn
over; the cooks, even by working all night, could
not supply the men with half rations; and there
was no protection whatever from the sun or the
rain.</p>

<p>Arrival at Fortress Monroe—Washington—Georgetown Heights—Monocacy
Junction—Up and down the Valley of the Shenandoah—Battle of
Opequan Creek.</p>
</div>

<div class="figleft illowe3_5" id="drop-O4">

<p class="drop-cap">ON the eighth day after crossing the bar off
the Mississippi, the ship reached Fortress
Monroe, where Lieut.-Colonel Richardson
received orders to proceed to Washington
immediately. Entering the Potomac, the
men realized that they were no longer on
Louisiana waters; the hills stretching up from the
river, the hay and grain fields just reaped, and the
scattering farm-houses, being in striking contrast
to the low banks of the Mississippi, with its plantations,
its negro cabins, its orange-trees, and its
alligators.</p>

<p>The steamer came to anchor off Alexandria;
and was subsequently towed up to a wharf in
Washington, the regiment remaining on board till
morning, when it landed and marched through
the city to Georgetown Heights. While resting on
the sidewalk in Pennsylvania Avenue, the regiment
received a visit from Col. Ingraham, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
appeared glad to see the boys, and who must have
been struck with the great change in the appearance
of his old command since he had last seen it.</p>

<p>All summer, the troops in Louisiana had been
obliged to drink warm, dirty water, from rivers,
bayous, and mud-holes; and when, upon arriving
at Georgetown Heights, two cool, delicious springs
were found bubbling out of the rocks, the satisfaction
was unbounded, and many men lingered
around them as if attracted by some fairy spell.</p>

<p>The stay in Georgetown was a short one. On
Sunday afternoon, July 31, the regiment broke
camp, and again marched through Washington,
to the Baltimore depot. The closed stores, the
crowd of church-going folks on the sidewalks, and
the absence of vehicles in the streets, told the men
of the Thirty Eighth that they were once more in
a land where the Sabbath was outwardly observed,
at least. A brief extract from a letter written a
day or two after the march through Washington
will give an idea of the interest which the arrival
of troops at that time excited.</p>

<p>“.... There was an interest and a curiosity
manifested by the citizens never exhibited in New
Orleans. In that city, regiments might march
through the streets from morning till night, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
no one would think of asking who they were, or
where they came from. In Washington, on the
contrary, the questions put to us were quite numerous.
The deep color burnt into our faces by
the Louisiana sun told plainly that we were no
militia men, even if our marching and general
appearance did not show it; and so the first question
was, ‘What corps do you belong to?’ ‘The
Nineteenth.’ ‘Oh, Banks’s men.’ And the inquirers
generally appeared to be pleased at the
information. A general surprise was shown at the
smallness of the regiment; and one man asked me,
‘What company is that?’ ‘<em>Company!</em>’ said I,
‘That’s the Thirty Eighth Massachusetts <em>regiment</em>.’
‘Where’s the rest of them?’ ‘A good many were
buried in Louisiana.’ ‘Oh, you belong to the
Nineteenth Corps.’ I expected, before we got
through Washington, to be asked what <em>squad</em> we
were.”</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the enemy then
threatened Washington by way of Harper’s Ferry,
and the arrival of the Nineteenth Corps was a great
relief to their fears, although the regiments appeared
small, accustomed as they were to the
arrival of new regiments with full ranks.</p>

<p>After a supper at the “Soldier’s Rest,” the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
took the cars about eight o’clock, and reached
Monocacy Junction a little before noon the next
day, going into camp in a reaped grain-field, near
the still smoking ruins of the depot, and in the
vicinity of the battle-field of Monocacy, where the
first division of the corps was then in camp.</p>

<p>No movement took place until the 4th of August,
when the cars were again taken, and, in company
with the Third Massachusetts Cavalry, which had
been dismounted, the regiment rode to Harper’s
Ferry, bivouacking for the night on the heights
overlooking the town.</p>

<p>August 6th, the army broke camp, and marched
to Halltown, four miles beyond Harper’s Ferry,
where the Thirty Eighth was attached to the first
brigade of the second division, then in command
<ins class="corr" id="tn-161" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'of Col. Macauley'">
of Col. McCauley</ins>, of the Eleventh Indiana. On
the 10th, the whole force, artillery, cavalry, and
infantry, under Gen. Sheridan, moved forward in
pursuit of the enemy, the cavalry skirmishing with
their rear-guard; and, on the night of the 12th,
the regiment went into camp a few miles beyond
Middletown, near Cedar Creek.</p>

<p>The men of the Nineteenth Corps, who had been
worn out by the Red River campaign, who had
regained but a small portion of their strength<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
while encamped on the banks of the Mississippi
under the burning sun, and who had been packed
almost as close as slaves on the transports, began
this new campaign under unfavorable circumstances.
Unlike the level plains of Louisiana, the
marching in this portion of Virginia was over hills
and through valleys, and the summer heat was
still intense; but the clear, cold springs all through
the valley were a luxury the Thirty Eighth was
unaccustomed to, and men lingered around them,
drinking again and again.</p>

<p>The army remained at Cedar Creek until near
midnight of the 15th, when, in danger of being
flanked by the enemy, the whole command fell
back toward Winchester, the Thirty Eighth going
into camp at Milltown, where they remained
during the day. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">reveillé</span> was beaten at one
o’clock, <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> of the 17th, and passing through
Winchester, the regiment reached Berryville at
noon, and went into camp.</p>

<p>Thursday, the 18th, opened with a rain-storm;
but the weather seldom interfered with Gen. Sheridan’s
operations, and the army still fell back, encamping
at night in the vicinity of Charlestown,
where the Thirty Eighth remained until the 20th,
when, in pursuance of orders, it changed camp, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
rejoined the third brigade, which had just arrived
in the Valley under the command of Col. Sharpe.</p>

<p>Sunday, Aug. 21, orders came to pack up; and
the regiment formed in line of battle, stacked arms,
and threw up breastworks, heavy skirmishing going
on at the front; but, during the evening, again fell
back, passed through Charlestown, and reached
Halltown at one <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, of the 23d, going into camp
for the night. During a heavy rain, the next day
the regiment built more breastworks, and then
moved to the left; but returned on the day following,
and remained in camp until Sunday, the 28th,
when the army again assumed the offensive, and
advanced to Summit Point, a few miles beyond
Charlestown. While these movements were being executed,
skirmishing between the advance of one
army and the rear of the other was continually
going on, and the cavalry were almost constantly
in the saddle.</p>

<p>On the 3d of September, the army again broke
camp, and marched to Berryville, where a sharp
encounter took place between a portion of the
Eighth Corps and Early’s force; but the enemy
retiring, the engagement did not become general.
The third brigade, however, formed in line of battle,
took up a position on a ledge of rocks, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
remained there all night, sending out two companies
as skirmishers. Every one was wet through,
and the wind swept coldly over the ledge.</p>

<p>Sunday, Sept. 4, the regiment was detached
from the brigade, and marched further to the
front, where new breastworks were thrown up, the
rain still continuing; the enemy, all the while,
shelling the line, and skirmishing constantly going
on. During the next fortnight, but little worthy
of mention transpired, except that the army here
completed a third line of breastworks.</p>

<p>On the 14th, a detail was sent from each company
to procure the blankets belonging to the men
in the regiment, which had been packed at Baton
Rouge previous to the Red River campaign, and
which were then supposed to be at Harper’s Ferry;
but upon the arrival of the detail at that place, it
was found that the boxes had been sent to Washington,
and the blankets were not received until
late in October. When the weather permitted,
company, battalion, and brigade drills took place
while the regiment was encamped in this place.</p>

<p>Although Gen. Sheridan kept his own counsels,
he was not deceived in regard to the movements
of Early. At three o’clock, on the morning of the
19th of September, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">reveillé</span> was beaten in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
camps, and the army marched through Berryville,
the Nineteenth Corps halting beyond, and being
informed that they would probably fight on that
spot. At this time, heavy cannonading was heard
on the right, and at the front, where the cavalry
was engaged. After halting an hour or two, the
Nineteenth Corps advanced by the flank, passing a
hospital into which great numbers of wounded men
were being brought, who had fallen when the cavalry
drove the enemy from the woods on each side
of the Winchester Pike. Passing through a defile,
the brigade came upon a high table-land, and
formed in line of battle on the edge of a belt of
woods between the opposing forces, the third brigade
being at this time on the extreme left of the
Nineteenth Corps, and connecting with the Sixth
Corps. Each regiment sent out skirmishers, who
advanced into the woods, followed by the brigade
in line of battle; and emerging on to an open
plain, which was crossed at a rapid pace, the
enemy were encountered in the woods beyond, and
the battle became hot.</p>

<p>The brigade had advanced too fast, leaving its
right flank exposed; and, unable to withstand the
heavy fire concentrated upon it, the Thirty Eighth
fell back, having lost many officers and men. At<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
one time, the battle-flag was within a few yards of
the banner of a rebel regiment, and its capture
seemed imminent; but color-sergeant Lunt, supported
by color-corporal Abbot, bravely carried it
through. Col. Sharpe and Lieut.-Col. Richardson
had been wounded; and the command of the brigade
devolved upon Lieut.-Col. Neafie, of the One
Hundred and Fifty Sixth New York, Maj. Allen
taking command of the Thirty Eighth.</p>

<p>The regiment, as usual, had gone into battle
with few officers. Lieuts. Whitney and Davis, and
Sergt. Palmer, in command of companies, had been
shot down, with many warrant officers, and many
men; and in the retreat, owing to this fact, and to
the nature of the ground, the regiment became
separated from the brigade, which had been partially
broken up by the impetuosity of the first
charge. The men, however, rallied around the
colors; and, under the lead of Major Allen and
Adjutant Wellington, again sought the front of the
fight.</p>

<p>After a desperate struggle, the enemy broke;
and, having formed his army in three crescent-shaped
lines of battle, Gen. Sheridan gave the order,
“Forward!” Before that victorious charge, the
veterans of Stonewall Jackson fled in confusion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
the whole rebel force went “whirling through
Winchester,” and the Union army remained in
possession of the hard-fought field.</p>

<p>The cavalry followed the retreating enemy, and
gathered up the spoils of the victory; but the
infantry went into camp on the outskirts of Winchester,
and rested from the labor and excitement
of the day, while the great news was silently speeding
its way North to electrify and gladden the loyal
hearts of the country. The Valley of the Shenandoah
was no longer to recall memories of defeat
and humiliation alone.</p>

<p>The loss in the regiment had been eight killed,
thirty-eight wounded, eight prisoners, and one
missing. A number afterward died from the
effects of the wounds received; but those captured
were remarkably fortunate, the majority of
them being paroled in a few days, and sent to
Annapolis.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE battle was won, and now came the pursuit.
Col. McCauley assumed the command
of the third brigade, which broke
camp at daylight of the 20th, and began the
march up the Valley, reaching Strasburg
in the evening. The next day, congratulatory
orders from the President and Gen. Grant
were read to the troops; and in the afternoon, the
regiment changed camp, and took a new position
on the hills overlooking Strasburg. The enemy
were strongly entrenched on Fisher’s hill, in a position
considered almost impregnable; but they
were not allowed to remain in undisturbed possession
long. At daylight, on the 22d, the Nineteenth
Corps moved up in front, and constructed
breastworks, driving in the rebel skirmishers from
their rifle-pits. The Eighth Corps, passing up the
north side of the mountain, took the enemy completely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
by surprise, while the Nineteenth Corps
charging in front, in three lines of battle, cheered
on by Sheridan, drove them in confusion from
their strongholds. It was near night, when the
rebels fled; and the pursuit was kept up till morning,
when Woodstock was reached.</p>

<p>In the heat of the pursuit, the advance forces
were fired into by an ambush, and one man instantly
killed. Some confusion ensuing, Gen.
Emory rode up, and inquired what regiment it
was. “Thirty Eighth,” was the reply. “Just the
regiment I want,” said the old veteran; and he
immediately formed the regiment in line of battle
across the pike.</p>

<p>Soon after, it was sent forward to skirmish, and
marched in that manner during the night, reaching
Woodstock in the morning, and remained there
till noon. Continuing the march, the brigade went
into camp at night beyond the beautiful little town
of Edenburg. The next day’s march (in column
by brigade) was a fatiguing one, the Nineteenth
Corps being obliged to make a flank movement at
Mount Jackson, to drive the rebels from a thickly
wooded hill beyond the Shenandoah River; and
upon going into camp beyond Newmarket, the rear-guard
of the retreating enemy was in sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>On Sunday, 25th, the brigade reached Harrisonburg,
which was then full of wounded rebels, and
remained quietly in camp until the 29th, when the
Nineteenth Corps and one division of the Sixth
Corps marched to Mount Crawford to support a
cavalry movement, the Thirty Eighth acting as
flankers, and being detailed at night as picket.
The next day, the entire force moved back to Harrisonburg,
having destroyed a great number of
barns and mills.</p>

<p>During this march up the Valley, rations were
often short, the supply-trains not being able to
keep up; and the army was obliged to live partly
on the country. The fine apples were especially
prized after the long abstinence from vegetables
and fruit; and the premium sheep afforded rich
repasts to the hungry boys, who seldom stopped to
inquire whether they were of the long or short
wool species. Indeed, some of the city boys of the
Thirty Eighth were not adepts in agricultural matters,
or one of them would not have approached a
“lord of the herd” with a coaxing “So, mooly;
so, mooly,” his dipper carefully concealed behind
him.</p>

<p>Remaining at Harrisonburg until Oct. 6th, on
that day the regiment marched to Newmarket,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
making eighteen miles, and, on the day following,
had a still harder march of twenty-two miles. Still
falling back, on the 8th Flint Hill was reached,
where there was much suffering from the cold. On
the 10th, after hearing orders from Gen. Sheridan,
announcing a large capture of artillery, wagons,
ambulances, and prisoners from Early, the army
moved back to Cedar Creek, and again constructed
breastworks. An engagement took place on the
14th, between a brigade of the Eighth Corps and
a portion of Early’s troops, in which the Thirty
Fourth Massachusetts lost heavily, Col. Wells, in
command of the brigade, being killed.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 18th, the third brigade
received orders to be in readiness in the morning
for a reconnoissance, and were in line before daylight
for that purpose, when a sudden crash of
musketry on the left, where the Eighth Corps were
encamped, gave intimation of an attack. The
brigade was ordered to the breastworks immediately,
and men sent forward to the creek, at the
base of the hill, to give notice of the approach of
the enemy. No attack was made in front; but,
on the left, having flanked the Eighth Corps, and
driven it back in confusion, the rebels fell upon
the Nineteenth, of which the third brigade of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
second division was the extreme left, the Thirty
Eighth being on the right of the brigade. Exposed
to a severe cross-fire, the brigade-commander, Col.
McCauley, being wounded, and the victorious rebels
sweeping all before them, the regiment fell back,
passed through the camp, and joined in the retreat.
At this time the battle seemed lost, and all
the manœuvring in the Valley for the past two
months thrown away; but the enemy failed to follow
up his advantage promptly; and the Union
army, recovering from the confusion into which it
had been thrown by the suddenness of the attack,
reformed its scattered ranks, and disputed the further
advance of the rebels, when the arrival of
Gen. Sheridan on the ground at noon, put a new
face upon matters. The army was no longer
without a leader. A temporary breastwork of
rails was thrown up, behind which the rebel advance
was awaited; and, as they drew near, a terrific
volley of musketry staggered and repulsed
them. The tide was turning. Riding over the
field, showing himself to every regiment, and everywhere
received with enthusiasm, the presence of a
master-spirit was at once felt; and when the proper
time came, and the order was given to charge,
the army advanced with a power that crushed all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
resistance. The cavalry dashed into the broken
ranks of the fleeing enemy, capturing them by
hundreds, while the infantry pressed on eagerly
toward the camps they had left in the morning.
In this final charge, for almost the first time in its
history, the regiment was in the second line of
battle.</p>

<p>Back over the battle-ground where they had triumphed
all day, over the Union breastworks, and
beyond Cedar Creek, in one confused mass, the
discomfited rebels fled, abandoning guns, wagons,
rations, and even the plunder of the Union camps;
while the victors took possession of their recovered
quarters.</p>

<p>The men had lost everything not on their persons,—clothing,
blankets, likenesses of friends,
letters, journals of the two years’ service, and mementos
of the Louisiana campaigns; and, worse
than all, over thirty of their comrades were on their
way to torture and starvation in Salisbury or the
Libby. Leaving the cavalry to pursue the flying
enemy, the infantry, cold and hungry, bivouacked
for the night on their old camp-grounds. In the
morning, the army moved two miles toward Strasburg,
and remained there until the 21st, when the
second division returned to Cedar Creek.</p>

<p>Congratulatory orders from the President to
Gen. Sheridan were read to the troops on the
24th; and, on the 26th, the ever-welcome face of
the paymaster appeared in camp. The Cambridge
companies were gratified, on the 30th, by a visit
from Mr. Wellington, who, as usual, brought many
articles for the comfort of the men. With the
exception of a corps review by Gens. Sheridan,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
Wright, Cook, and Emory, on the 7th of November,
nothing of importance transpired until the
9th, when the army fell back to Kearnstown, and
went into quarters between that village and Winchester
(Camp Russell), where heavy breastworks
were thrown up. The enemy had not yet left the
Valley. On the evening of the 10th, the wagons
were packed in anticipation of an attack; and
there was lively skirmishing at the front during
the next day; but, the enemy did not appear in
force, and Powell’s cavalry by a bold dash, made
a large capture of prisoners and munitions of war.</p>

<p>Monday afternoon, Nov. 14, the regiment broke
camp, and marched to Winchester; and, on the
following morning started for Martinsburg, as
guard to a supply-train, making the entire distance,
twenty-two miles, before night. Leaving
Martinsburg on the 19th, the regiment returned to
camp near Winchester, and resumed camp duties.</p>

<p>The picket duty at Camp Russell was very severe,
especially as the weather grew cold. No
fires were allowed at night; a vidette was thrown
out from every post; and, at daybreak, the picket-line
deployed, and remained so until sunrise. At
the same time, every regiment stood in line of battle
behind the breastworks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>Thanksgiving Day, the regiment received a portion
of the poultry sent from the North for the
soldiers; and, by clubbing together, nearly all the
messes had a tolerable soup. A real Thanksgiving,
however, arrived from Cambridge on the 27th;
and then Cos. A, B, and F had turkeys and chickens
and puddings in abundance. If the kind
friends at home could have looked into those little
tents at Camp Russell, at that time, they would
have considered themselves repaid for all their
trouble.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">PREPARATIONS now began to be made
for passing the winter at Camp Russell.
The shelter-tents afforded poor protection
against the snow-storms, which were becoming
frequent, and boards were scarce;
so, in every camp, log-villages arose, many
of them far neater in appearance than the tenements
in which families of poor whites had been
reared on the banks of the Red River.</p>

<p>The regiment was putting up its last row of
huts, when a sudden stop was put to all further
work, by the reception, on the afternoon of the
20th, of marching orders; and before daylight
the next morning, in the midst of a driving storm,
the third brigade broke camp, and marched to
Winchester, where the Thirty Eighth was selected
to do provost duty, and quartered in deserted
buildings in the vicinity of the Court House. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
portion of the duty here consisted in guarding
the rebel prisoners brought in by the cavalry,
and in taking squads of them to Harper’s Ferry.</p>

<p>The people in Winchester, and all through the
Valley, were bitter foes to the Union, giving constant
information to the enemy of all military
movements; and many of the prominent citizens
had been sent to Fort Henry, in Baltimore. The
women adhered to the Confederate cause with a
tenacity that could not but win respect, and daily
brought baskets of food to the captured rebels.
One day, it was the duty of the writer to notify
the citizens to have the snow taken off their sidewalks
within a certain specified time,—not a very
pleasant task considering that the majority of the
houses were tenanted by females. Some quietly
said it should be done; others were not so tractable.
One fair dame said, in a rich Virginia accent,
that we had taken all the men off, and that
she would see us “durn’d” before she’d shovel
snow: she’d “go to the gurd-house first.” Fortunately,
a “right smart rain” that night did the
work, and saved the dignity of the fair ones.</p>

<p>The provost duty at Winchester was of short
duration. Marching orders were received on the
5th of January; and before daylight the next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
morning, the regiment was groping its way
through the silent streets to the outskirts of the
town, where it awaited the arrival of the brigade,
under command of Lieut.-Col. Richardson, who
had recovered from his wound, and returned to
duty a few days previously.</p>

<p>The railroad terminated at Stephenson’s station,
five miles from Winchester, and upon reaching
that place, the brigade was obliged to wait several
hours in a cold rain-storm while the train was
made up, when, packed close in cattle-cars and on
them, the division again brought together, rode to
Baltimore, reaching that city on the morning of
the 7th. The journey had been an uncomfortable
one, those on the outside being exposed all night
to the storm, while the men were packed so close
inside that holes had to be cut in the cars to let in
fresh air.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at Baltimore, the division quartered
in the cavalry stables at Camp Carroll, near
the old camp, Emory, from which the regiment
had departed over two years before. The weather
was cold, the boards were partly off the buildings,
and the only way to keep comfortable was by
building large fires in the centre of the stable, the
smoke from which found its way in time through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
the crevices in the roof. The Twenty Second
Iowa occupied one side of the stable; and when
the two regiments were frying pork over dozens of
fires up and down the length of the building, it
required strong lungs to stand the smoke and
smell. Nevertheless, one Boston lady, Mrs. James
H. Norris, an agent of the Christian Commission,
learning that a Massachusetts regiment was in
Baltimore, found it out, braved the unpleasant
surroundings, and delivered mittens, socks, needle-books,
etc., not only to those who needed them in
the Thirty Eighth, but also to the Iowa boys.
The regiment also had the pleasure of a visit
from an old friend, the Rev. Dr. Ware, formerly
of Cambridge, then pastor of a church in Baltimore,
who had once made a visit to Camp Emory,
and who now came loaded with packages of tobacco,
stationery, and other articles acceptable to
soldiers who had been months without pay. The
doctor distributed his treasures not only to the
Thirty Eighth, but to the Iowa boys on the opposite
side of the stable. Dr. Ware repeated his
visit, and gave an account of the impressions he
received in two letters to the “Cambridge Chronicle,”
which were perused with much pleasure by
the men of the Thirty Eighth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>The following extracts from these interesting
letters will give the reader a view of the regiment
from the “outside”:—</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>“.... It was a clear, cold Sunday,—a day like the finest
of our New England winter days, and a walk of some three
miles brought me to the camp. What memories it awoke!
Not three years ago, close by, lay encamped the Thirty Eighth,
on the crest of a hill, surrounded by other regiments of the
same brigade. Everything about war was new then, and I
well remember how clean and neat the whole camp was, and
with what pains every man rubbed his buttons, and blacked
his boots, and brushed his coat, and kept his gun.</p>

<p>“I remember, too, the admirable drills, the perfect dress-parade,
in such marked contrast with all the regiments about.
I remember a brigade review, in which I stood a delighted
listener to the praises heaped upon the Thirty Eighth, by New
York officers not on duty. The last time I saw Col. Rodman—the
friend of many years, who fell before Port Hudson—was
there at evening parade. I see his fine form before
me now. I recall his pride in the appearance of his men,—how
we lingered and chatted after the parade was over,—how
we parted at the camp lines,—neither he, nor many others
then there in life and hope, to come back to their homes
again.</p>

<p>“All this and more was in my mind as I walked up and
down the camp of —— thousand men, asking for the Mass.
Thirty Eighth in vain. Chancing to remember that regimental
numbers are not apt to be known beyond the regiment, I
asked for the Third brigade, and at last was told that in a certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
long barn I should find the Thirty Eighth, on the right
hand side,—the left being occupied by some other regiment.
I remembered the stable as belonging to the cavalry of Emory’s
brigade two years and a half ago. It was made of rough
boards, which probably never had matched, and the wind and
wet, the cold and heat of the months since had not drawn
them any more closely together. As I entered, the sight was
one of which those at home can form no conception. All
down the long centre of the building, at company intervals,
were circular piles of logs, around which men were grouped
as thick as they could sit, some chatting, some singing, some
eating, some silent. On either side were others taking their
supper, sitting or lying on the ground, or writing letters; while
in grand promiscuousness, blankets, cups, plates, knapsacks lay
about everywhere. You could scarcely keep your eyes open
for the smoke, which these old campaigners did not seem to
notice. And here was what was left of the Thirty Eighth,—not
spruce and nice as when I last saw them, but thinned by
battle and disease, four hundred and seventy out of a thousand,—and
now, just from a journey of fearful exposure and
cold, bearing signs of the life they had led since we parted.</p>

<p>“.... I recognized some; more recognized me, and I
hope they enjoyed the meeting as much as I did. How I
wished the home folk could be there! It would have made
their hearts ache a little to see how without the shadow of a
comfort these men were, while they would have glowed with
pride at the genuine, uncomplaining manhood before them.
They had supposed themselves fixed for the winter. Orders
had been sent commanders to see the men properly housed.
Things were settling down into the inactivity of the cold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
season. The Thirty Eighth was doing provost duty in Winchester,
when Thursday evening orders came to march at six
the next morning.</p>

<p>“It was a day of cold and rain and wind. That day, that
night, into the next forenoon, in baggage, on platform, in uncleaned
cattle-cars—on them as well—this division journeyed.
We have had no such cold hereabout this winter—some
were frost-bitten, but none seriously. Saturday noon
found them at ‘Camp Carroll,’—the old summer residence of
Charles Carroll—weary, cold, and hungry, with bare shelter
from the winds, and such straw for bed as any individual foraging
would supply. And yet they spoke of the comfortable
quarters! I pulled my coat about my ears as the wind whistled
by,—I looked out through the chasms in the barrack sides at
the clear, cold moonshine,—I looked up at the dense smoke
hiding the roof,—I looked around at men’s faces as the camp-fires
lighted them up,—and I wished again that the men and
women at home might see and hear these men, and be glad as I
was in their devotion, and learn, as I did, something from their
cheerful endurance. It gave me the old feeling of shame that
I was not with them in body as well as in heart, and my citizen’s
dress seemed to me as a badge of disgrace, while the contrast
between the scene before me and the comforts I came
from, and should return to, was painful indeed. It is a good
gift of God that the soldier can be so content in his lot,—as
we said,—‘asking no questions of the future, but taking the
present as it comes.’</p>

<p>“I went in and out all over that camp, and I saw much the
same thing repeated everywhere. A happier, more contented
set of men you would not find. Bound they knew not where,—I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
wished that I did not,—the one desire seemed to be to
get this thing through that they might be at home again. As I
threaded my way out, I heard one man, sitting by the fire, say,
in half soliloquy, ‘Who would think this was Sunday night!’—‘Little
enough like the old Sunday nights at home,’ I said in
passing; and I walked out into the night, and by the challenges
of the guard, and over the fields, and looked back at the
camp and down upon the great city, and heard the evening bells,
and knew how well-dressed, comfortable people would soon be
gathered to their worship, little imagining what Sunday night
was to those who suffer peril, privation, absence from home,
and all civil pleasure and privilege, that they might enjoy
churches and home in quiet. I doubt not there was in the
camp, that night, as hearty service in many a heart as in the
city cathedral, chapel, or church.</p>

<p>“On Monday, 9th, I again made my way to their camp. If
you had my eyes, you could realize better than you can with
the help of my pen, how the inexorable laws of military rank
showed themselves in the matter of the different head-quarters.
The division commander and his staff were in the mansion-house
of the ever-venerable Charles Carroll, outside the lines.
The brigade commander and his staff were in a two-story building,
no way near as good as my old barn; the staff and line of
the regiment were in a similar building, but they seemed to have
about as much room for all of them as the brigade-commander
had to himself. Even in such details, in a casual camp, you
are impressed with the difference that a little priority in rank
makes. And now from regimental quarters, even to company
quarters, from the tight walls and roof of the barrack to the
gaping sides and roof of the stable, from the comfortable stove,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
though its nose be thrust out of a window, to the fires of logs
all up and down the sitting, dining, sleeping room—all in one—of
our friends of ‘the rank and file,’—the contrast is very
great—yes, painful; none the less so because the men bear it
so well. Speaking to the officers of the state of things, more
than one said he had tried to go through the smoke, and had
given it up.</p>

<p>“Tuesday came. During the night had come up one of
those rains for which this latitude is a little too famous. There
is no half-way about them. I had waked, more than once,
and thought of the poor fellows out there in the camp in the
mud,—for this stable of theirs had no floor to it, and was on
the slope of the hill. As soon as I could, I pulled on my cavalry
boots, and in the old ‘Reserve Guard’ overcoat, minus
the buttons of brass, made my way to the city, and filling a
carpet-bag with chewing and smoking tobacco, newspapers, pictorial
papers, dominoes, and various kinds of puzzles, started
for camp. I found the stable more comfortable than I had
feared, and distributed my treasures to eager hands and thankful
lips, and, I think, hearts. It was a real pleasure to see the
pipes filled, the quid rolled on the tongue, and men here and
there settling themselves to their papers and games. The
Twenty Second Iowa, on the other side of the stable, came in
for a share, and as I heard one of them say over my shoulder,
‘That bag holds out like the widow’s cruse,’ I could not help
wishing it did, and not one of those eight thousand men—the
number is not contraband now—but should have had something
to comfort him that comfortless day.</p>

<p>“Crossing the camp, I met, ankle deep in mud, Lieut. Davis,
whom I last saw in hospital, just from home, looking exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
nice, but not quite well enough for such rough weather
and work. Lieut. Whitney, whom I had also seen while here
wounded, I was sorry to hear had been discharged. He is
well spoken of by every one, and the last thing he said to me
was that he hoped to get back to his regiment before it was all
over. I think government is a ‘little rough’ upon the men
she can no longer use. It is a poor way, it is a mean way of
reducing expenses, if that is the object. A <span class="allsmcap">MAN</span> is something
after all, even in such a crisis as this, and a man, scarred and
disabled, should be ‘tenderly cared for.’ No government can
afford to be without a heart!</p>

<p>“On Wednesday the weather was clear and cooler, and though
the chances were that camp would be broken up, one brigade
having marched in the rain the day previous, I again took my
bag, filled with paper, envelopes, pencils, and newspapers, and
found our friends still in their old quarters. From inquiry I
had learned they were in need of these things, but when I
had satisfied their demands, I had still ‘a few more left.’
Coming up to a squad of <em>Iowa</em> men, I said, ‘Any of you here
would like some paper?’ Not a word in reply. Every man
seemed stolid and dumb. They sat about their logs, and
looked in the fire. At last one, somewhat hesitatingly, got
up, and put his hand in his pocket and drew out two or three
pieces of ‘fractional currency,’ and said, ‘I <em>should</em> like a little,
but I don’t know as I have money enough to pay for it.’
‘My friend,’ said I, ‘you haven’t money enough to pay for it.
That isn’t what I am at. If you want paper, take it and welcome.’
You should have seen the change,—up sprung those
stolid, dumb men: ‘I should like a sheet of paper, if you
please, sir.’ ‘Can you spare me an envelope?’ ‘Thank you,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
sir.’ ‘I should like a pencil.’ I was the centre of eager men.
You should have seen those hands stretched from all sides
toward me,—hands grimed with dirt, but honest, and hearty,
and loyal hands, that had been clasped in agony by dear ones
far away, hands that had toiled for the dear country God has
given us,—hands, dirty, indeed, but there was an expression
in their fingers and palms as they eagerly waited for their
turn, such as I never detected in the unsoiled, delicate hand
of which some men as well as some women are foolishly vain.
The same thing struck me that always does in hospital and
camp,—a certain reserve and modesty. They asked for one
or two sheets, or envelopes, but almost invariably replied to
my inquiry, if that was really all they wanted, that they would
like more if I had them to spare. Before I left, I saw many
‘writing home.’ As I finished, one man came up to me and
said, ‘Have you any more of the puzzles you had yesterday?’
and I was sorry I had not. Thinking the brigade must leave
before I could come out, as rations again for fifteen days had
been served, I said ‘Good-by’ and ‘God bless you,’ expressing
the hope that I might find out when they sailed, and give
them one good, hearty Massachusetts cheer.</p>

<p>“Sitting with the men on the knapsacks they piled for me,
I felt that I came to know something of them, and in some
sort as if I were a link between them and the home we all
alike love. I found them a little inclined to be thoughtful, not
gloomy at all, but they had been disappointed in finding themselves
ordered on active duty just at the time that furloughs
were being granted and they were feeling sure of reaching
home. Some had not seen home since the day of that march
from Camp Cameron, which none will forget. I think that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
being here so long and inactive increased the feeling, and it
would not surprise me if a little homesickness lurked underneath.
Their destination was a thing of uncertainty. They
hoped not Petersburg,—many desired Louisiana; but as soon
as the rations were given they said, ‘You can’t long keep things
from an old soldier,—this means Wilmington or Savannah.’
The leading topic seemed the coming home again in August.</p>

<p>“One would have supposed these men would stand in need
of some of that aid we are so anxious at all times to give.
What was my surprise to find them packing up their superfluous
baggage to send home! They looked like men in very
light marching order, but I believe a soldier has always something
he can do without. I was sorry to find they had not
been paid recently. How unjust this seems! I was glad to
hear them praise Sheridan; and glad, Mr. Editor, of another
thing,—to hear them put Massachusetts first, and then Cambridge
a little ahead of her! Didn’t I join hands with them
there? If you at home love the old city as well as we whose
various duties call us away, and will keep her up not merely
to what she has been, but to what she can be, we will do all
we can to prove ourselves citizens of no mean city, of whose
doings she need not be ashamed.</p>

<p>“Before this stands in type they may have again looked
upon the battle glare; they may have tasted reverse; they
may have won some new honor to their flag, new laurels to
themselves; they may have written their names among the
immortal band whose fidelity and courage shall ensure that
redemption of the country to which we are ‘marching on!’”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE third brigade left Camp Carroll, Jan.
13th, and, marching through the streets of
Baltimore,—its citizens not scowling at
the troops as they did two years before,—took
transports at the wharves, the Thirty
Eighth embarking on the Oriental, in company
with the One Hundred and Seventy Fifth and
One Hundred and Seventy Sixth New York.</p>

<p>As usual, there were no cooking facilities; but
the men had brought excellent appetites from the
Shenandoah Valley, and two men found no difficulty
in eating a raw ham in the eight days’ passage.
Stores were taken on board at Fortress
Monroe, and, at three o’clock, <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, of the 15th,
the steamer took her departure for the South, arriving
at the mouth of the Savannah River on the
19th, where she remained waiting for a pilot until
the 23d.</p>

<p>No large ship had been up the main channel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
through the obstructions, since the occupation of
Savannah by Gen. Sherman; and the undertaking
was a delicate one. The men of the three regiments
crowded the rigging and the deck, barely
giving the pilot a chance to see his course; but
had it been generally known that there were
seventeen torpedoes still in the harbor, between
the anchorage and the city, curiosity might not
have been so active.</p>

<p>The passage of the obstructions was successfully
made, and the city reached before dark. The
warehouses, the wharves, and the few citizens
seen, all had a decayed, broken-down look; and
the fog hanging over the river added to the gloominess
of the scene. On the Mississippi and in the
Shenandoah Valley, the men of the Thirty Eighth
had seen the destruction produced by actual conflict,
where the shot and shell had whirled through
the air, and plunged into storehouse and dwelling:
here, they saw the effects of war on the prosperity
of a thriving commercial city, which had seen no
battle horrors, but which had been shut up within
itself, to live on its own resources.</p>

<p>The regiment remained on board until morning,
and then went into quarters in a warehouse on
Bay Street, where it remained until the 26th, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
weather still being cool enough to make ice at
night. At this time, Savannah presented a scene
of desolation sad to behold, even in an enemy’s
country. Pools of green, stagnant water stood in
the principal streets; the beautiful squares had
been stripped of their railings and fences to build
the shanties of Sherman’s troops, who were encamped
all through the city; the houses, as well
as the stores, were shut up, and apparently tenantless;
the broad avenues were deserted, except by
passing soldiers, who vainly tried to fathom the
mystery of the closed blinds, wondering if this
were not one of the charmed cities pictured by
Eastern story-tellers; and a green mould, beginning
at the basement, seemed to be creeping up
the sides of the houses.</p>

<p>Early Thursday morning, the 26th, the regiment
left its quarters in Bay Street, and marched to the
outskirts of the town, halting on the edge of a
swamp, where the collection of dead mules and
horses only awaited the rays of the summer sun
to breed pestilence and death. At first, it was
supposed that the halt in this, the most dismal-looking
place to be found in the vicinity of
Savannah, was to be only a temporary one; but, to
the intense disgust of officers and men, orders were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
received to lay out a camp. However, as Sherman’s
troops were breaking camp to begin their
famous march through the Carolinas, boards were
plenty; and, in a few days, the regiment was more
comfortably housed than it had yet been; while
the mules and horses were buried, the company
streets graded, and every precaution taken to make
the camp healthy.</p>

<p>Sherman’s army, after leaving Savannah, were
obstructed in their march by the flooding of the
low lands; and it was still uncertain whether
Hardee and Beauregard would permit him to
sweep through the country unopposed. Consequently,
some commotion existed in the camps
of the second division of the Nineteenth Corps,
when a sudden explosion of shells took place at
midnight on the 27th. At first, it was thought by
some, that Sherman had been forced back; but
the church-bells beginning to ring, and the explosions
becoming more rapid, the fact soon became
apparent that the arsenal in which the rebel ammunition
had been stored was on fire. A detachment
from the regiment was sent for, and, under
direction of Lieut. Copeland, who took charge of
the engines, did efficient service in checking the
progress of the fire, not, however, before it had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
destroyed a great many blocks of brick and stone
buildings. The negroes worked manfully at the
engines, some of them being struck by the fragments
of falling shells, which were thrown at a
great distance over the city; but those of the inhabitants
who were not immediately affected by
the catastrophe, stood idly on the corners of the
streets, with their hands in their pockets.</p>

<p>Afterward, another call was made, for all who
were in camp to go on guard in the streets to prevent
pillaging; and the entire regiment remained
until daylight, when, returning to camp, in an
hour or two, the greater part were detailed for
picket or fatigue. The fatigue duty consisted in
unloading stores sent from Boston and New York to
the “suffering poor,” who were too lazy to unload
it themselves. The duty of the regiment in Savannah
consisted in unloading commissary stores,
furnishing guards and pickets, and building breastworks;
the men being on duty nearly every other
night.</p>

<p>Gradually, the people began to steal out of their
houses, and business, which always followed in the
track of the Union armies, became better; but
there was no loyalty yet. While the citizens condescended
to take the supplies of food furnished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
by government and by the North, their sympathies
were with Lee behind the breastworks of Richmond,
and with Johnson in Carolina. As soon as
Gen. Grover took command of the post, he set all
the unemployed people, black and white, at work
cleaning up the city, and, in a short time, the
streets were drained, the squares put in order, and
the dead animals buried. Concerts were given in
the Park several times a week by the bands of the
Ninth Connecticut and the Fourteenth New Hampshire,
and special guards appointed to preserve
order; but, in spite of all the general could do for
the comfort and pleasure of the citizens, they remained
sulky.</p>

<p>The clergymen, especially, clung to the fortunes
of the falling Confederacy; and notwithstanding a
large portion of their audience on Sunday consisted
of Union officers and soldiers, not a word of sympathy
was expressed for the government, nor a
word of reprobation for the cruelties of Andersonville,
which were casting a blot on the fair fame
of Georgia never to be forgotten while one victim
of that prison-pen survives.</p>

<p>On Sunday the 19th, news was received of the
evacuation of Charleston, and the guns of Fort
Pulaski announced the fact to the unwilling ears<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
of the citizens. The birthday of Washington was
celebrated by the firing of salutes, ringing of bells,
and a cessation from all unnecessary labor. Good
news now began to pour in fast. The fall of
Charleston was soon followed by that of Wilmington;
and the men began to lay plans, which they
had never done before, of what they would do
“when the war was over.” But the journeyings
of the Thirty Eighth were not yet at an end. By
the time the “shebangs” were made comfortable,
and the camp-ground in good condition, marching
orders were received, and the brigade was notified
to pack up preparatory to taking transports.</p>

<p>On the 4th of March, the Twenty Fourth Iowa
and the One Hundred and Seventy Sixth New
York broke camp; and the next day, the Thirty
Eighth, the One Hundred and Twenty Eighth, and
the One Hundred and Fifty Sixth, accompanied by
the band of the latter regiment, marched through
the city, treating the citizens who were returning
from church to a taste of Union music, and embarked
on the steamer Ashland. Not one of
the six regiments composing the brigade having a
colonel present, the command was conferred upon
Col. Day, of the One Hundred and Thirty First
New York.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AT daylight, the steamer left the city arriving
at Hilton Head about noon, where, after
transferring the brigade head-quarters and
a portion of the One Hundred and Fifty
Sixth to another ship, she anchored for the
night. Leaving Hilton Head the morning
of the 7th, the mouth of Cape Fear River was
reached about noon the next day. A flag was
hoisted for a pilot; but none responding, the captain
of the ship determined to follow the lead of
another steamer, and go up to Wilmington. The
Ashland was about a hundred yards astern of the
other ship, when the latter suddenly grounded,
and a collision seemed certain. Fortunately, there
was time to change the direction, and the Ashland
rubbed by, smashing a quarter-boat in the contact.
Had the distance between the two vessels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
been a few yards less, the effect upon both might
have been disastrous.</p>

<p>Coming to an anchor off Fort Caswell, the troops
had an opportunity to see the effects of heavy shot
on an iron-clad,—one of the monitors that had
taken part in the assault on Fort Fisher lying
near. Soon a despatch-boat came alongside, with
orders for the vessel to run up as far as Smithville,
and there await further instructions.</p>

<p>While anchored off Smithville, a boat came down
the river loaded with paroled prisoners, among
them a number of the Thirty Eighth, who had
been captured at Cedar Creek, had been sent to
Salisbury prison, and were paroled upon the approach
of Sherman’s cavalry. They all told the
same old story of hunger and exposure.</p>

<p>After some delay, a pilot was procured, and the
steamer started again for Wilmington, but owing
to a thick fog, did not reach the city until morning,
when, as she was hauling into the wharf, a
harbor-master hailed the captain, wanting to know
what brought him there when he had orders to go
to sea. Down went the anchor again, and Lieut.-Col.
Richardson went on shore to report, and see
if anybody knew anything about the third brigade
of the second division of the Nineteenth Army<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
Corps. Getting instructions, the lieutenant-colonel
returned, and the ship again steamed down the
river. Passing by Forts Anderson and Caswell, by
the obstructions in the river, and by the wreck of
Admiral Porter’s mock-monitor, the ship again
anchored, and waited for the fog to lift. In the
afternoon, a pilot came aboard, and, it being then
clear, the steamer stood out to sea, the earthworks
of Fort Fisher looming up like hills in the distance.</p>

<p>After a pleasant voyage along the coast of North
Carolina, the transport reached Morehead City on
the afternoon of the 8th, and landed the troops,
who marched through the straggling village, and
stacked arms beside the railroad track. The place
was full of rumors in regard to fighting at Kinston,
where Johnston was trying to overpower Schofield
before the arrival of Sherman; and all the
available troops were being sent to the front.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock, <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, the regiment crowded
into and on top of its portion of an immense
train of box-cars, and after a moonlight ride
through the turpentine forests of North Carolina,
reached Newbern at midnight, waking the town
with cheers; for the brisk March air made the blood
run quick, and the men were in the best of spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>Disembarking at the depot, the regiment stacked
arms, and soon numerous camp-fires were blazing,
and the indispensable coffee boiling.</p>

<p>The rumors had grown less warlike as the train
approached Newbern; and upon arriving at that
place, the troops were informed that they were just
too late,—that the fighting was all over, and that
their services were not needed. The men of the
third brigade had been in the field too long to be
“spoiling for a fight,” and were not sorry at being
“counted out” of a battle just on the eve of
peace.</p>

<p>The night was sufficiently frosty to harden the
ground; and after drinking their coffee, the men
spread their blankets, and were soon in repose. In
the morning, the brigade marched a short distance
beyond the city, and quartered in buildings formerly
occupied as a hospital.</p>

<p>Newbern had been occupied for so long a time
by the Union forces, that its garrison had acquired
habits different from those in vogue in campaigning
regiments; and the advent in their midst of
such a brigade as the third made quite a commotion.
As soon as they had stacked arms, the men,
as usual, began to hunt for boards and other articles
to make themselves comfortable, in case of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
going into camp in the vicinity. In an out-building,
some A tents were found packed away; and,
as A tents were a luxury the Thirty Eighth had
not known for many days, they were at once appropriated.
A commissary sergeant of a certain
Massachusetts regiment soon came after the property,
saying that they belonged to his company,
and that he would be responsible for them. “No,
you won’t,” said the Company E boys, whose portion
of the prize was claimed. “You can account
for them as lost in action.” This way of accounting
for property was beyond the commissary’s experience,
and he invoked the aid of the adjutant
to recover the tents. He supposed that he got
them, but afterward two canvas structures towered
suspiciously above the dog-tents at Morehead.</p>

<p>There being no call for the services of the regiment
at Newbern, it was sent back to Morehead
City, arriving at that place in the afternoon, and
going into camp in a grave-yard, between the railroad
track and the river. The Nineteenth Corps
was pretty well broken up at this time,—the first
division being still in the Valley with Sheridan,
the second division scattered through Georgia and
Carolina, and the third division in Louisiana.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>Morehead City had been selected as the base of
supplies for Sherman’s army, and wharves were being
built, storehouses erected, and additional railroad
tracks laid, while the harbor was crowded with
vessels of all descriptions, awaiting their turn to be
unloaded. The work of unloading the ships and
loading the cars was done principally by the men of
the third brigade, assisted by colored soldiers and
contrabands; and there was no cessation of labor,
night or day,—one detail going on, when another
came off. As a relief to the hard work, oysters and
clams were to be procured in abundance a few
hundred yards from the camp; and, as soon as the
tide receded, the beach was covered with oystermen.</p>

<p>Nothing occurred to break the monotony of the
daily and nightly fatigue duty till Sunday, March
26th, when one of the old Louisiana style of
“scares” took place. The assembly sounded, the
regiment formed in line, and the pickets were reinforced;
but beyond the blaze and smoke from a
large fire in the pine woods, and the occasional discharge
of a piece of artillery, no signs of any
enemy were seen, and it soon appeared that the
alarm had been occasioned by the report of an
“intelligent contraband,” that the enemy was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
marching on Morehead in force,—said contraband
having heard a battery practising at a target.</p>

<p>April 7, the great news of the battle in front of
Richmond and Petersburg, resulting in the defeat
of Lee, was read to the troops, causing much rejoicing,
although they did not commit such extravagances
as the speculators in the exchanges of
New York and Boston,—accounts of whose proceedings
were read with amazement by the soldiers
in the field.</p>

<p>A change had been made in the military programme,
and Morehead was no longer to be the
great base of supplies. At noon of the 8th, orders
were received to pack up, and three o’clock, <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>,
found the Thirty Eighth and the One Hundred
and Fifty Sixth again on the road to Newbern on
platform cars. Newbern was not the destination,
however; and the train finally reached Goldsborough
at three o’clock in the morning. Great
numbers of recruits and high-bounty men had
passed over the road lately; and, at the various
wood and water stations, the old soldiers gathered
around the train with such queries as, “How
much bounty did you get?” “How long did you
enlist for?” “Where’s your cow?” etc. One
fellow, trying to get a nearer look in the moonlight,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
exclaimed, “Why, they are colored troops.”
So they were “colored,” compared with many who
had passed over the road lately. When it was
known that the brigade had been “in the Valley
with Sheridan,” there was a change in the tone of
the remarks.</p>

<p>The regiment bivouacked near the depot till
morning, when the back mails that had been sent
to Savannah, arrived, and were assorted. Sherman’s
entire army was encamped about Goldsborough;
and the five corps broke camp, and began
the march toward Raleigh the day after the arrival
of the Thirty Eighth. Among all that force of
veteran troops, none appeared to better advantage,
or had a more military bearing, than the famous
Thirty Third Massachusetts, who had charged under
Joe Hooker at Lookout Mountain, and who had
marched from Atlanta to Savannah, and thence
to Goldsborough.</p>

<p>Upon the departure of Gen. Schofield, Gen.
Birge was left in command of the post, and the
Thirty Eighth selected to do duty in the town,—Cos.
A, B, D, and K as provost guards, and the
remaining six companies to guard the commissary stores.</p>

<p>Two days after the departure of Sherman’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
troops, the news of Lee’s surrender was received,
and glad enough were the men of the Thirty
Eighth that the grand old Army of the Potomac
had the honor of giving the finishing stroke to the
rebellion.</p>

<p>While the whole army was jubilant at the speedy
prospect of peace, and of the country being once
more united, and when a feeling of pity for the
defeated rebels was becoming prevalent among
the soldiers, a wild rumor reached Goldsborough
on the 17th that President Lincoln had been assassinated.
The news was so horrible that it was not
believed, and the next day it was reported that he
had received only a slight flesh wound.</p>

<p>Then came the tidings that Johnston had surrendered
his entire force to Sherman; and, without
knowing the precise terms,—willing to put all
confidence in Sherman’s integrity,—the soldiers
in North Carolina gave way to an enthusiasm that
none of the previous victories had excited. All
day they poured into the government printing-office
to learn if the report was official; and crowds
gathered about the orders posted on the buildings.
But the next day, the report of the assassination
was confirmed; and then a revulsion of feeling took
place, and Eastern and Western men alike, in stern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
tones, hoped that hostilities would be resumed.
Few of the citizens of Raleigh or Goldsborough
dreamed of the slumbering fire in their midst, that
the least provocation would have fanned into a
flame that would have destroyed all before it; and
it required all of Gen. Sherman’s tact to keep his
men quiet.</p>

<p>The paroled rebel soldiers, to their credit be it
said, were unanimous in denouncing the assassination;
and were determined to allow of no guerilla
warfare in the State, now that the main armies had
surrendered. Perfect good feeling existed between
the late belligerents, although it was rather tantalizing
to the Union soldiers, who had been from
home so long, to see the ladies crowd around and
caress the gray jackets.</p>

<p>The terms of Johnston’s surrender not proving
acceptable at Washington, a new arrangement was
made; and the lieutenant-general himself came on
to ratify it. On his return, while passing through
Goldsborough, a wheel came off the engine, and
the general was obliged to leave the car, and wait
for another locomotive. The news soon spread
that Gen. Grant was in town; and he was flanked
at every turn by the admiring soldiers, who didn’t
ask him for a <em>speech</em>, however.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>The companies on provost were quartered in
the Court House; and those doing guard-duty
had erected comfortable “shebangs,” with the hope
of occupying them until they left for home, when
marching orders were received, and colored troops
arrived to relieve them. Breaking camp during
the evening of the 1st of May, the regiment bivouacked
in the grounds of the Court House till morning,
and then took the cars for Morehead City.</p>

<p>At all the little settlements on the road, women
waved their handkerchiefs, probably glad enough
to see the stream of blue-coats again turned northward.
Passing through Newbern, the train reached
Morehead about sundown, and the regiment bivouacked
in the old camp-ground, among the graves,
where it remained until the 4th, when it embarked
on the transport Thetis, in company with the One
Hundred and Twentieth New York and the <em>division
horses</em>!</p>

<p>The men thought they had already tasted every
flavor capable of being produced from coffee; but
a new experience awaited them on this transport.
The drink was made by putting the ground coffee
in an empty pork-barrel, and letting on steam
through a rubber hose; and the result was a beverage
in which the taste of the barrel, the rubber<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
hose, the cask-water, and the coffee, struggled for
the mastery. One ration was sufficient for some
companies, although the New York boys drank
a quart of it twice or three times a day.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 6th, after a search of several
hours for Hilton Head, the officers of the
steamer ascertained their whereabouts; and, at
noon, the ship arrived off the Savannah River,
when a pilot was procured, and the voyage continued
to Savannah. The troops remained on
board until Sunday morning; when they disembarked,
and took possession of the camps just
vacated by a portion of the first brigade, which had
gone to Augusta.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/icaps.jpg" alt="letter S" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">SAVANNAH had changed essentially within
the past two months. By the surrender
of Lee and Johnston, all hopes of establishing
Southern independence were at an
end; and the people were evidently about
to submit quietly, and make the best of
their situation. The streets swarmed with paroled
rebels; and the gold stripes and fine uniforms of
the Union staff-officers had no attractions in the
eyes of the ladies, compared with the simple gray
jackets of those they had sent into the field, and
whom they now warmly welcomed home, notwithstanding
the failure of their arms. The tenacity
with which the females of the Southern States clung
to their cause, and the great sacrifices which they
made for it, could not but win the respect of those
who witnessed it; and seldom did a Union soldier,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
no matter what might be the provocation, treat
them with other than the most respectful courtesy.
But no such feelings were felt for the clergy, who
were equally devoted to the rebel cause. Preachers
of the gospel of peace, they had been foremost
in fomenting the rebellion; they had never lifted
their voices against the cruelties of the prisons,—which
exceeded those of Morocco in her worst
days,—or tried in the least to soften the barbarities
of war; and now, when all hope of Southern success
was at an end, and resistance to the government,
either active or passive, a crime, they yielded
a sullen submission, or opposed a petty resistance
to the acts of the military rulers. And it is a
strange fact, that, even in the Northern pulpit, the
demands for vengeance against the military leaders
of the Confederacy were greater than any that
proceeded from the army; and more than one
minister advocated the breaking of the agreement
on the faith of which Lee surrendered to Gen.
Grant,—a proceeding which would have been
looked upon with disgust by every soldier in the
army, as much as they detested Lee and his treason.
As the Thirty Eighth Regiment never had
the services of a chaplain, even to give their dead
comrades a Christian burial, perhaps they were not
properly instructed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>Not only in the appearance and sentiments of
the citizens had a change taken place in Savannah;
but the city itself had greatly improved under the
auspices of Gen. Grover, and it had become one of
the most desirable places in which to do garrison
duty in the South. Time hung heavily, however,
on the hands of the men of the Thirty Eighth.
The war was over; the object for which they
had volunteered was accomplished; and now they
wished to lay aside their uniforms, and resume
their citizenship. Beside, every mail from the
North brought accounts of the mustering out of
troops, and of the reduction of the army.</p>

<p>On the 11th of May, the second brigade and the
Twenty Fourth Iowa and the One Hundred and
Twenty Eighth New York broke camp, to march
to Augusta, leaving the remaining regiments of
the third brigade to do the light picket-duty,
which was now merely nominal, and which was
kept up chiefly to prevent an illicit trade between
the city and the country before proper regulations
were established.</p>

<p>The appearance and habits of the country people,
who daily passed out and in the lines, were
amusing to men who had been accustomed to the
New England way of doing things. Some of them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
came thirty miles to market, with a dozen or two
of eggs, a pair of chickens, and a few vegetables.
It took them one day to come, another to do their
business, and a third to return. And then such
vehicles were never seen north of Mason and Dixon’s
line. The women generally accompanied their
husbands, and rode on the mule attached to the
wagon, with a snuff-stick or a pipe in their mouth.
Sometimes, on reaching the picket-fire, they would
take the snuff-stick out, and get one of the pickets
to light their pipe; and, if reports were true, when
the pipe went out, a quid of tobacco would take its
place. This custom of snuff-dipping appeared to
be practised chiefly in Georgia and North Carolina,—in
the latter State, ladies of intelligence and
refinement indulging in the habit: it was not
observed in Louisiana.</p>

<p>Little occurred during the remainder of the stay
in Savannah to break the monotony of camp-life,
or which is deserving of record. The regiment
daily looked for orders which would send them
home, and all the conversation and thought of the
men turned to that theme. On the 16th, Jeff.
Davis passed down the river, on the way to Hilton
Head. A portion of the Sixth U. S. Regulars arrived
on the 21st, and quartered in the town,—all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
branches of the service being now represented,
regulars, volunteers, and colored troops. The
dress-parades of the latter were attended by almost
the entire colored population, who, upon
the close of the parade, swarmed through the
principal avenues, monopolizing the sidewalks, to
the annoyance of the white citizens, and the
amusement of the soldiers.</p>

<p>Thursday, June 1, Cos. C and G, under command
of Capt. Bennett, started for Darien, Ga.,
with twenty days’ rations; and the regiment gave
up all hope of getting home before their full time
was served. The picket was taken off on the 2d,
and restrictions to trade removed; and the only
duty to be done consisted in furnishing a few
guards to watch the breastworks.</p>

<p>The re-enlisted regiments of the first division of
the Nineteenth Corps began to arrive in Savannah
on the 5th of June, for the purpose of relieving
those troops whose time would expire before the
1st of November; and the hopes of getting home
in a few days arose again. On the 7th, the first
brigade reached the city from Augusta; and, on
the 9th, the Twenty Fourth Iowa, and the One
Hundred and Fifty Sixth, the One Hundred and
Seventy Fifth, and One Hundred and Seventy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
Sixth New York began the march for that
place.</p>

<p>Time had never passed so slowly with the regiment
before, as during this month of June, when
there was nothing to do but to talk of home all
the long summer-day. Some tried to pass the
time in picking blackberries; some in manufacturing
bone rings, corps badges, and other trinkets;
while others, and in the afternoon this class included
nearly the whole regiment, sought refuge
in sleep. The occasional arrival of a mail brought
a little change; but then the letters and papers
were all filled with accounts of the return home of
regiments, and with the anxiety with which friends
awaited the Thirty Eighth. Attempts were made
to excite an interest in drilling; but it was up-hill
work, and officers and men alike soon tired of it.</p>

<p>Orders, at last, came from department head-quarters
to muster out the regiment; and on the
9th, the officers began to work on a few copies
of blank rolls that had been received; but Cos
C and G were still absent, and delegations from
the camp hourly visited the wharves, and closely
scanned every approaching steamer, to be the first
to herald their arrival. The first question upon
awaking in the morning was, “Have C and G got<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
back yet?” At length, the well known beat of
drummer Howe was heard in the camp, and the
men rushed out of their tents to greet their comrades,
who were never so welcome before. Major
Allen, who had been acting as provost marshal at
Augusta, joined the regiment the same day, and
other detailed men were returned to their commands.</p>

<p>By some oversight in the chief mustering officers’
department, there were no blank-rolls on hand, and
none arrived until the 23d; but then all other
duties were at once suspended, including an inspection
which was to have taken place, and the
officers worked night and day on the rolls. On
the 26th, the recruits, and the colored under-cooks
who had been enlisted at Baton Rouge, less than
thirty in all, were transferred to the Twenty Sixth
Massachusetts, leaving the regiment with less than
three hundred of the ten hundred and forty who
had left the State three summers previously.</p>

<p>Finally, the papers were all completed; but
there was no transportation. It seemed to be the
fate of the regiment to <ins class="corr" id="tn-215" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'serve tits full time'">
serve its full time</ins> out. Every other regiment organized under the call of
1862 had already reached home; and, on account
of their being a greater portion of their time in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
a distant department, probably fewer men of the
Thirty Eighth had ever received furloughs than
those of any other command. Ill feeling began to
arise between the men and the officers, the former,
in their nervous, excited state, charging their officers
with not using proper exertions to get home.
A few words, however, from the lieut.-colonel, at
the close of the last dress-parade that took place,
on the evening of the 29th, cleared away the
cloud and restored good feeling.</p>

<p>In the forenoon of June 30, the welcome orders
came, “strike tents, to go home.” The orders had
scarcely left the mouths of the orderlies, before the
men were swarming on the roofs of the shebangs.</p>

<p>The shelter-tents and mosquito-nets, with all
property belonging to the government, except guns
and equipments, were at once turned in, and the
knapsacks packed ready to start.</p>

<p>An order had been issued by the war department,
a short time previously, allowing the soldiers
to keep their guns and equipments by paying six
dollars each for them,—about the price they
would bring at a public sale; nearly all the men
in the Thirty Eighth had concluded to take them,
and for several days previous to this had been
busily at work, polishing the barrels, varnishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
the stocks, and making covers to keep them in
good order on the passage home.</p>

<p>At five o’clock, the assembly was blown, the regimental
line formed, and, escorted by the drum-corps
of the One Hundred and Twenty Eighth
New York, the regiment marched through the
city, with muzzled guns, and embarked on the
steamer Fairbanks,—a small blockade-runner,
barely large enough to accommodate the reduced
command.</p>

<p>The boat left the wharf at eleven o’clock, and
proceeded down the river, anchoring at the mouth
until daylight, when she steamed up to Hilton
Head, to land a portion of the cargo. At two,
<span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, she left Hilton Head, and steered north. It
was the general desire to reach home before the
4th of July, but the sailing qualities displayed by
the transport during the first two days dispelled
that hope. On the afternoon of Wednesday,
Gay’s Head was made,—the first New England
land the majority of the regiment had seen
for three years. A pilot was taken off Holmes’s
Hole, and the men retired to their quarters with
the expectation of being in Boston Bay before
morning. But it was the day after the Fourth,
and the lights looked hazy to the eyes of the old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
pilot; so he concluded to anchor back of Cape Cod
until morning. The cool northern breeze was in
striking contrast to the soft summer airs of Savannah;
and the men shivered under the slight
clothing they had brought.</p>

<p>In the morning, the ship weighed anchor, and
continued the voyage. It seemed as if Cape Cod
would never be doubled: headland succeeded
headland, until, finally, the point was passed, and
the bay entered. As the towns and villages on
the South Shore came in sight, eager eyes were
strained to catch a glimpse of the one spot so long
the object of thought. The luxuriant banks of
the Mississippi, or the historical ones of the Potomac,
had no charms compared with the dwarfed
shrubbery of Cohasset, of Scituate, of Marshfield,
and of Plymouth.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock, the steamer cast anchor off Deer
Island. The pilot objected to taking her up to the
wharf without a permit from the health officers;
and the lieut.-colonel and Surgeon Ward went on
shore, and procured the necessary papers. But
the regiment was not allowed to get home so
easily. Just as the mouth of the harbor was entered,
a sputtering little quartermaster’s boat came
alongside and ordered the captain to land the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
troops at Gallop’s Island. The lieutenant-colonel,
however, had been too long in the field to
take orders from every boy who talked loudly,
and directed the captain to proceed to the wharf.
When off Long Wharf, the tug-boat again came
alongside, and the officer, in a more respectful tone,
informed the commander of the regiment that the
order for the troops to land on the island was from
head-quarters, and, at the same time, offered to
take him on shore to report. It was now midnight;
and there being no hope of landing, the
men left the decks and retired.</p>

<p>The morning opened with a cold rain; and at
nine o’clock, the steamer proceeded to Gallop’s
Island, where the regiment landed, and went into
quarters in barracks. Here, in sight of the homes
from which most of them had been absent for three
years, the men remained while the muster-out rolls
were being examined, and preparations made to
pay them. Three passes to each company were
allowed for twenty-four hours; but a majority of
the men lived at such a distance that they were of
no avail.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the City of Cambridge had
been making great preparations to give the entire
regiment a reception; and the furloughed soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
were everywhere questioned in the streets by the
school-children as to their discharge.</p>

<p>The rolls were at last pronounced correct; and
on the evening of the 12th, the paymaster announced
his intention of coming to the island the
next morning. A grand illumination of the barracks
took place that night, while the rolls were
being signed; and the officers on duty on the
island found it difficult to enforce the order in
regard to putting out the lights at taps. Early on
the morning of the 13th, the companies formed in
line, marched to the office of the paymaster, signed
the rolls for eleven months’ pay, and received the
honorable discharge so eagerly looked forward to.
Then, taking passage on the ferry-boat the regiment
landed on Commercial Wharf, where it was
met by the Committee of Reception from Cambridge,
who had provided teams to carry the knapsacks.</p>

<p>Headed by Gilmore’s band, the regiment marched
through Boston to Craigie’s Bridge, where its
arrival was announced by a salute, and by the
ringing of bells. A long procession here awaited
to escort it through East and Old Cambridge to the
pavilion erected at Cambridgeport. The military
companies appeared with full members; the Reserve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
Guard,—in whose ranks were noticed old friends
who had visited the regiment in field and camp,—had
left their business to welcome the returned
volunteers; the firemen had decorated and polished
their engines until they looked like elaborate
pieces of ornamental work; a cavalcade of
ladies, dressed with exquisite taste and with
cheeks freshened by the spirited exercise, graced
the occasion with their presence; while thousands
of school-children, bubbling over with joy, lined
the streets.</p>

<p>And in addition to all, there were old comrades-in-arms,—some
who had been stricken down by
the storm of lead that filled the air on that June
Sunday at Port Hudson; others who, wounded
and faint, had anxiously watched the ebb and flow
of victory at the Opequan; still others who had
experienced the horrors of Salisbury, after the
surprise at Cedar Creek. Not until then did the
men know how close were the ties that bound those
together who for months or years had shared a
common lot. But the regiment was now in the
hands of its friends; and the account of its reception
will be told in the words of the “Cambridge
Chronicle” of the following Saturday,
greatly condensed, however:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>Thursday last (the day of the reception of the gallant
Thirty Eighth regiment, three full companies of which were
recruited from this city) was the greatest day Cambridge has
ever known. Every heart beat high with exultant joy and
pride, for there was not a citizen, young or old, who did not
have a special interest in the patriot soldiers whose return
has made us all so happy in the repossession of our brave
soldier sons, brothers, husbands, and friends.</p>

<p>The reception was a magnificent testimonial of the esteem
in which the services of our soldiers are held by a grateful
people. It was an ovation, wherein the whole people, the
young and the old, the rich and the poor, united together to
do honor to the citizen soldiers who went forth to secure the
blessings of Liberty, Union, and Peace to a distracted country.
Right nobly have they accomplished their holy work! After
many weary marches, through many a battle and skirmish,
their patient endurance has been rewarded by victory so complete,
that it would seem to be the termination of rebellion
in this country forever, and of the foul spirit that inaugurated
and controlled it.</p>

<p>Never has our city worn a happier, a more brilliant, or a
more social aspect. The streets were thronged with the people,
who seemed anxious to express by their presence, their
joy at the return of our volunteers. Their lively holiday
attire added largely to the gay appearance, which the decorations
that met the eye on every hand, gave to the streets
through which the procession marched.</p>

<p>The reception was as honorable to the city as it was creditable
to the feelings that prompted it, and must have been
particularly gratifying to the regiment, from the fact that it
has had no trumpeter to blazon forth its every act, and to
continually reiterate the assertion that in the prosecution of
the holy war it has excelled all other regiments. The universality
of the demonstrations of “Welcome Home,”—the
approving cheers, the cordial grasping of hands, the thanks
beaming from every eye attested that its course had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
anxiously marked and highly approved,—that, having enlisted
for the war, they realized that their duty was plain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Theirs not to reason why,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Theirs but to do or die.”</div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="p2 pfs80">THE RECEPTION.</p>

<p>The morning of the 13th dawned, but no bright sunlight
gave promise of a pleasant day; many forebodings of rain,
troubled the good citizens of Cambridge, which, as the day
progressed, were banished by the dispersion of threatening
clouds, and nature exhibited as magnificent a day as the
most critical could desire for the reception of the gallant heroes
of the Thirty Eighth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The regiment arrived at Cragie’s Bridge about half past
twelve,—when the Cambridge Light Battery, Capt. Adams,
consisting of ex-members of the Ninth and Eleventh Batteries
thundered forth the loud welcoming notes, which proclaimed to
the anxiously awaiting citizens that the hour of doubt had
passed; that Cambridge had at last received her noble heroes
within her own borders.</p>

<p>Warm, indeed, was the reception at the bridge; great,
indeed, was the temptation to break ranks, but discipline overcame
the waverings of affection toward relations and friends
long separated, and with firm, elastic step, and with joyous
smiles, the veterans, headed by their loved lieutenant-colonel,
who has been acting colonel nearly all the time they have been
in service, passed through the open ranks of the thousands who
had assembled to do them honor. On—on through the long
line they passed, greeted by cheers which can only be given
when the heart is in full sympathy with its object. The gallant
colonel, bareheaded, bowed his head on either side in
acknowledgment of the tokens of regard, and so they passed
to Cambridge Street. Here the procession was formed as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>


<p class="p2 pfs80">MOVING OF THE PROCESSION—DECORATIONS, &amp;C.</p>

<p>The procession moved from Cragie’s Bridge under a line
of flags and streamers,—upon which appeared the mottoes,
“Heroes of 1862, worthy sons of the heroes of 1776. We
welcome our brave defenders.”</p>

<p>The procession passed up Cambridge Street under a line of
flags and streamers, and a large shield bearing the inscriptions,
“All hail to the Stars and Stripes.” “Honor to the brave
defenders of the Star-Spangled Banner.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The grand feature of the reception in East Cambridge was
presented between Fourth and Fifth Streets. Here ropes had
been drawn along each side of Cambridge Street, and on the
south side were ranged about eight hundred children from the
public schools in East Cambridge, bearing small flags and bouquets
in their hands. The Putnam and Thorndike Grammar
Schools were designated by shield-like bannerets, bearing the
names of the schools. On the opposite side of the street, a
long table was spread with a bounteous supply of cake, pies,
sandwiches, and other tempting baits to hungry men, to appease
their appetites. This pleasing feature was an impromptu one,
conceived by the ladies on the evening previous, and executed
in good taste.</p>

<p>As the procession passed this point, the school-children sang
patriot songs of welcome. When the veterans reached it they
were halted for a few minutes, and partook of a light collation
provided for them, washing it down with tea or coffee as they
preferred. This being accomplished, it was the children’s turn
at presentation. They presented their bouquets to the soldiers,
who then took up the line of march, when all the scholars
partook of a bountiful collation from the same table.</p>

<p>The procession passed on through Cambridge and Winsor
streets to Broadway, along which it passed under flags and
streamers, bearing mottoes of welcome, and acknowledgments
of thanks, passing houses appropriately decorated,—among
which was a beautifully draped portrait of the martyr president,—to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
Prospect Street. Here a line of flags and streamers
was pendent, and a motto, “Death to Treason.”</p>

<p>On Prospect Street, at the residence of J. C. Wellington,
Esq., sixteen beautiful young ladies, dressed alike, in white
waists and black skirts, trimmed with national colors, emblems
of Love and Hope and Faith, were ranged. Each held in her
hand a splendid bouquet, which they presented to the veterans
as they passed. The decorations in this vicinity were superb;
among which was an elegantly mounted full-length painting
of the Father of his country. Among the mottoes here were,
“You left your homes at the call of duty. You return victorious,
the nation saved.” “1776. Liberty. 1865. May we
never forget your comrades who sacrificed their lives on the
altar of liberty.”</p>

<p>From Prospect Street the procession moved on through
Harvard Street to Quincy. Lines of flags and streamers
crossed Harvard Street at different points; nearly every house
exhibited, by flags, drapery, or mottoes, the thanks and esteem
of the residents. The Mayor’s residence was very elegantly
decorated, and bore the mottoes, “All hail to the Stars and
Stripes.” “Welcome!” “One Flag—One Country—One
Constitution,”—“Welcome Veterans.”</p>

<p>On the south side of Harvard Street, near the Mayor’s
residence, fifteen hundred scholars of the different schools of
Old Cambridge and Cambridgeport were stationed to do their
part in the outpouring of welcome home to the veterans. It
was the most pleasing feature of the day. The hundreds of
happy children, bearing flowers and flags, singing songs of welcome
home, waving their tiny flags, and swelling the pæans of
praise and welcome to the returned braves, was indeed well
calculated to please, and will doubtless remain vividly impressed
on the memories of the beholders, until long after those
little ones have become actively engaged in the manifold cares
and duties, joys, sorrows, frivolities, and responsibilities of adult
life. Bannerets were distributed through the ranks of the
scholars bearing the inscriptions, “Cambridge High School”—“Harvard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
Grammar School”—“Webster Grammar School”—“Allston
Grammar School”—“Washington Grammar School”—“Shepard
Grammar School.” As the veterans passed the
scholars, they were made the recipients of so many flowers,
that some difficulty was experienced as to the disposition they
should make of them.</p>

<p>The procession passed on through Harvard and Quincy
Streets to Broadway; thence to North Avenue, and to Harvard
Square, amid the shouts of welcome from the hosts that
were assembled in the front of “Old Harvard.” As the procession
passed from Broadway, through Harvard Square to
Main Street, an opportunity was afforded to take something
like a full view of the whole.</p>

<p>It was a magnificent scene as the procession passed from
Broadway to North Avenue, and through the Square. The
profusion of flowers among the military escort, and veterans,
the gayly caparisoned horses of the marshal <ins class="corr" id="tn-227" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'and his aids'">
and his aides</ins>, the
tall figure of Col. Richardson, mounted on a splendid charger
bowing his acknowledgments on either hand, the proud bearing
of the veterans, their torn and shot-riddled colors, the
throng of cheering welcomes, the glittering polish of the steam
fire apparatus, decorated with choice flowers, the uniform of
the Fire Department, the larger part wearing scarlet jackets,
the long line of Cavalcade, with their banners,—all combined
to make a display worthy of transfer to canvas as a
memorial of the happy day. Here were seen to great advantage
the banners, mottoes, and inscriptions borne in the procession.</p>

<p>The procession continued through Main Street, toward the
City Hall, passing many elegantly decorated residences, among
which that of the Hon. J. M. S. Williams called forth praise
from all observers. The City Hall was tastefully decorated
with bunting. In the centre of the Main Street front was an
architectural display, representing a Temple, consisting of an
arch springing from pillars, on which were the figures of Victory
and Peace. In the arch was the motto “Emancipation;”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
and the inscription, “The sun will never rise over a nation
more glorious than ours.” The lower part of the temple was
filled in with blue silk, on which, in letters of gold, was inscribed
“One Country, one Constitution, one Destiny.” Across the
street a line of flags and streamers was suspended.</p>

<p>The members of the City Government and invited guests
here took up their places in the procession, which moved on
toward the Universalist Church. At this point, clouds which
for the past half hour had been gathering overhead, and which
it had been hoped would pass over, and away, commenced to
discharge their contents. Many of the spectators, who had
thronged in the vicinity to witness the countermarch from
Columbia to Magazine Street, sought refuge in the houses and
stores, which were thrown open for shelter. With every minute
the violence of the storm increased, drenching every one.</p>

<p>The children, representing the States, were taken for shelter
into Williams Hall, but not before some of them were wet
through; and thereby prevented from fulfilling their part of
the programme of the exercises in the tent,—among which
was to have been the delivery <ins class="corr" id="tn-228" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'of beautiful address'">
of a beautiful address</ins> to the veterans
by Miss Nettie Blake. Mrs. Peters, under whose direction,
and by whose patriotic labors, the design was so far carried
out, was deprived of the reward of her labors in the successful
consummation of her designs. She will doubtless feel compensated
in part by the great applause her troops of pretty ones
elicited on the route.</p>

<p>Although the rain poured in torrents, the procession moved
on, and countermarched at Columbia Street up Main Street.
Through Magazine Street passed the procession, the rain still
pouring in torrents, until the head of it reached the tent. The
rain gradually ceased, and before the procession commenced to
file into the tent, the sun came forth in its splendor.</p>

<p>The procession marched around the tent, and entered it at
the north end. Here the selected scholars were seated on
raised seats on the west side, wet through, for the tent had
been a poor shelter from the heavy rain which had fallen.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
As the veterans entered, they were received, as elsewhere,
with shouts and songs of welcome. Plates were laid for fourteen
hundred guests, and were speedily turned by that number.</p>

<p>The tent, notwithstanding the rain, presented a cheerful
aspect to the wet and hungry guests. A large tablet presented
on one side the list of twenty-two battles from Fort
Sumter to Gettysburg. On the reverse, another list of twenty-two,
from Fort Donaldson to Richmond. Along the sides, and
at the end of the tent, were mottoes of welcome, and scrolls
with the words, “Bisland”—“Cane River”—“Port Hudson”—“Opequan”—“Winchester”—“Fisher’s
Hill,” and “Cedar Creek,” which recalled the deeds in arms of the gallant
Thirty Eighth.</p>
</div>

<p>In obedience to the order of the Mayor, the regiment
made an attack on the refreshment tables,
and achieved a complete victory. The assembly
was then called to order, and an eloquent address
of welcome made by Mayor Merrill, which was appropriately
responded to by Lieut.-Col. Richardson.
Addresses were also made by ex-Governor Washburn,
ex-Mayor Russell, and Gen. Hincks. But
the volunteers, many of whom lived at a distance,
were anxious to reach the homes where their presence
was so eagerly awaited, and the majority
took their leave as soon as the repast was ended.
A display of fireworks in the evening closed the
ceremonies of the day.</p>

<p>All honor to Cambridge, who never forgot her
soldiers in the field, and who welcomed them home<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
more warmly than she sent them away. Many
whose citizenship is in other portions of the State
will long remember her deeds, and rejoice at her
prosperity.</p>

<p>Warm welcomes were extended to the men from
New Bedford, Lynn, Abington, and other towns,
upon their arrival home. Company E was tendered
a public reception by the city authorities
of Lynn, but declined the honor. Abington gave
a fine reception to all her returned soldiers, including
those belonging to the Thirty Eighth.</p>

<p>Four months have now passed since the members
of the Thirty Eighth Massachusetts Regiment
resumed their duties as citizens. They have settled
in different portions of the country, and are
engaged in all the various branches of civil industry;
but not one has brought discredit upon
the fair fame of the regiment, or proved that he is
less capable of being a good citizen because he
became a soldier at the call of the country.</p>

<div class="p2 pfs90">REMARKS ON THE ROLLS.</div>

<div class="fs80">
<p>The Thirty Eighth Regiment received but few recruits after
leaving the State; and consequently it soon became reduced
in numbers below the standard required by the War Department
for a full complement of officers; so that there were no
promotions, except to warrant offices, after the second year.
Previously to being mustered out, complimentary commissions
were issued, corresponding to the vacancies.</p>

<p>In the foregoing rolls of the various companies, whenever
the date is not mentioned in connection with a sergeant or
corporal, it is to be understood that he held the original
appointment.</p>

<p>The name of the town to which each man is credited, except
in two or three instances, is the one for which he enlisted, and
is not always his place of residence.</p>

<p>Should any reader discover any error in the foregoing rolls,
he will confer a favor upon the author by informing him of it.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
